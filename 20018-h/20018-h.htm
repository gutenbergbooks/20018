OR, THE CHRISTMAS GUEST.</h2>

<h3>BY MARIA J. McINTOSH.</h3>

<p class='center'><i>Illustrated with Ten Steel Engravings, 8vo., cloth, gilt edges, $3; morocco, $4.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The whole sparkle with strokes of pleasantry and lively criticism, and ever and
anon reveal most delightful pictures of fireside groups. A high-toned morality pervades
the whole. We feel sure that the book will be a general favorite."&mdash;<i>Commercial Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>"It is a book that parents may buy for their children, brothers for their sisters, or
husbands for their wives, with the assurance that the book will not only give pleasure,
but convey lessons of love and charity that can hardly fail to leave durable impressions
of moral and social duty upon the mind and heart of the reader."&mdash;<i>Evening Mirror.</i></p></div>

<h2>WOMAN IN AMERICA;
HER WORK AND HER REWARD.</h2>

<h3>BY MARIA J. McINTOSH.</h3>

<p class='center'><i>One Volume, 12mo., paper covers, 50c.; cloth, 75c.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We like this work exceedingly, and our fair countrywomen will admire it still more
than we do. It is written in the true spirit, and evinces extensive observation of society,
a clear insight into the evils surrounding and pressing down her sex, and a glorious determination
to expose and remove them. Read her work. She will win a willing way to
the heart and home of woman, and her mission will be found to be one of beneficence
and love. Truly, woman has her work and her reward."&mdash;<i>American Spectator.</i></p>

<p>"We thank Miss McIntosh for her 'Woman in America.' She has written a clever
book, containing much good 'word and truth,' many valuable thoughts and reflections,
which ought to be carefully considered by every American lady."&mdash;<i>Protestant Churchman.</i></p></div>

<h2>CHARMS AND COUNTER-CHARMS.
</h2>
<h3>BY MARIA J. McINTOSH.
</h3>
<p class='center'><i>One Volume, 12mo., cloth, $1; or in Two Parts, paper, 75c.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This is one of those healthful, <i>truthful</i> works of fiction, which improve the heart
and enlighten the judgment, whilst they furnish amusement to the passing hour. The style
is clear, easy and simple, and the construction of the story artistic in a high degree. We
commend most cordially the book."&mdash;<i>Tribune.</i></p></div>

<h2>TWO LIVES; OR, TO SEEM AND TO BE.</h2>

<h3>BY MARIA J. McINTOSH.</h3>

<p class='center'><i>One Volume, 12mo., paper covers, 50c.; cloth, 75c.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The previous works of Miss McIntosh, although issued anonymously, have been
popular in the best sense of the word. The simple beauty of her narratives, combining
pure sentiment with high principle, and noble views of life and its duties, ought to win
for them a hearing at every fireside in our land. We have rarely perused a tale more
interesting and instructive than the one before us, and we commend it most cordially to
the attention of all our readers."&mdash;<i>Protestant Churchman.</i></p></div>

<p>In Miss McIntosh we fondly and proudly greet a transatlantic
sister, and as delightedly introduce her, a
"<span class="smcap">Christmas Guest</span>," to our own home circle. She is
worthy of all honor and affection.</p>

<p>Miss McIntosh's writings are eminently pure in feeling&mdash;tender,
graceful, and elegant in manner. Their
moral, simply and unstrainedly developed, is invariably
excellent&mdash;generously exciting, stimulating, encouraging
all the noblest energies of our nature. To use her own
words, addressed to her friends in America, and with
equal propriety may they be accepted by the rising generation,
and by every grade of society, at every period of
life, in her unforgotten fatherland&mdash;"From the examples
she will present to them, they may learn that to the
brave and true and faithful heart, 'all things are possible'&mdash;that
he who clings to the good and the holy amidst
temptation and trial, will find peace and light within
him, though all without be storm and darkness; and
that in a right understanding and unfaltering perform<a class='page' name ='Page_6' id='Page_6' title='6'>&nbsp;</a>ance
of duty&mdash;not in the pomps and pleasures of a self-indulgent
life, lie our true glory and happiness."</p>

<p>Not a tale, not a sketch, not an appeal to the heart
or to the mind in any form, does our fair sister commit
to paper, that is not pervaded, though unobtrusively, by
a strain of the sweetest, gentlest, most cheerful and soul-elevating
piety; it is hers at once to soothe, to charm,
and to exhilarate.</p>

<p>Our "<span class="smcap">Christmas Guest</span>" well knows how to furnish
forth a feast of infinite variety. Few, if any, will
arise from a perusal of her delightful "word-painting"
of life, incident, adventure, and character, without being
wiser, better, happier; without enjoying a more entire
confidingness in Heaven&mdash;in <span class="smcap">Him</span>, that <i>God of love and
goodness</i>, whom Christians unite to worship.</p>

<p><a name="INTRODUCTORY" id="INTRODUCTORY"></a>The largest and the most picturesque country-house of all I
know in America, is the mansion house of my friends, the
Donaldsons. I would gladly inform the reader of its locality,
but this Colonel Donaldson has positively prohibited, for a
reason too flattering to my self-love to be resisted.</p>

<p>"You know, my dear Madam,"&mdash;I give his own words, by
which I hope the courteous reader will understand that I am
really too modest even to seem to adopt the flattering sentiment
they convey&mdash;"You know, my dear madam, that your
description will be read by every body who is any body, and
that through it my simple home will become classic ground.
If I permit you to direct the tourist tribe to it, I shall be
pestered out of my life when summer comes, by travelling
artists, would-be poets, and romantic young ladies."</p>

<p>I may not therefore, dear reader, tell you whether this
pleasant abode be washed by the waves of the Atlantic or by<a class='page' name ='Page_10' id='Page_10' title='10'>&nbsp;</a>
the turbid current of the Mississippi; whether it be fanned by
the flower-laden zephyrs of the South, or by the health-inspiring
breezes of the North. The exterior must indeed have been left
wholly to your imagination, had I not fortunately obtained a
sketch from a young friend, an <i>amateur</i> artist, of whom I shall
have more to say presently. As I could not in honor present
you with even this poor substitute, as I trust you will consider
it, for my word-painting, without Colonel Donaldson's consent,
I have been compelled, in deference to his wish, to divest the
picture of every thing that would mark the geographical position
of the place represented. The shape of its noble old trees we
have been permitted to retain; but their foliage we have been
obliged to render so indistinctly, that even Linn&aelig;us himself
would find it impossible to decide whether it belonged to the
elm of the North when clothed in all its summer luxuriance, or
to the gigantic live-oak of the South. Even of the house itself
we have been permitted to give but a rear view, lest the more
marked features of the landscape in front should hint of its
whereabouts. As to the figures which appear in the foreground
of the picture, they are but figments of my young artist
friend's imagination. One of them you may observe carries
under the arm a sheaf of wheat, not a stalk of which I assure
you ever grew on the Donaldson lands.</p>

<p>Even from this imperfect picture of the exterior, you will
perceive that the house is, as I have said, both large and picturesque.
Within, the rooms go rambling about in such a
strange fashion, that an unaccustomed guest attempting to make
his way without a guide to the <i>chambre de nuit</i> in which he
had slept only the night before, would be very apt to find himself
in the condition of a certain bird celebrated in nursery
rhymes as wandering,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Up stairs and down stairs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the ladies' chambers.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_11' id='Page_11' title='11'>&nbsp;</a>In this house have the Donaldsons lived and died for
nearly two hundred years, and during all that time they have
never failed to observe the Christmas with right genuine, old
English hospitality. Then, their sons and their daughters,
their men-servants and their maid-servants, and the stranger
within their gates, felt the genial influence of their gratitude to
Him who added year after year almost unbroken temporal
prosperity to the priceless gift commemorated by that festival.
At many of these <i>r&euml;unions</i> it has been my good fortune to be
present. Indeed, though only "<span class="smcap">Aunt</span> Nancy," by that courtesy
which so often accords to the single sisterhood some endearing
title, as a consolation, I presume, for the more honorable
one of <span class="smcap">Mrs.</span> which their good or evil fortune has denied
them, I have been ever received at Donaldson Manor as at my
own familiar home; nor was it matter of surprise to myself or
to our mutual friends, when the Col. and Mrs. Donaldson
named their fourth daughter after me, modifying the old-fashioned
Nancy, however, into its more agreeable synonyme of
Annie.</p>

<p>This daughter has been, of course, my peculiar pet. In
truth, however, she has been scarcely less the peculiar pet of
father and mother, brothers and sisters, friends and neighbors&mdash;sweet
Annie Donaldson, as all unite in calling her, and certainly
a sweeter, fresher bud of beauty never opened to the
light than my name-child. And yet, reader, it may be that
could I faithfully stamp her portrait on my page, you would
exclaim at my taste, and declare there was no beauty in it.
I will even acknowledge that you may be right, and that there
is nothing artistically beautiful in the dark-gray eyes, the clear
and healthy yet not dazzlingly fair complexion, the straight
though glossy dark-brown hair, and the form, rounded and
buoyant, but neither tall enough to be dignified nor <i>petite</i>
enough to be fairy-like. But sure I am that you could not<a class='page' name ='Page_12' id='Page_12' title='12'>&nbsp;</a>
know the spirit, gentle and playful yet lofty and earnest, which
looks out from her eyes and speaks in her clear, silvery tones
and graceful gestures, without feeling that Annie Donaldson is
beautiful. Nor am I alone in this opinion. My friend Mr.
Arlington fully agrees with me, as you would be convinced if
you could see the admiring expression with which he gazes on
her. As this gentleman cannot plead the Colonel's reason for
any reserve respecting his place of residence, I shall not hesitate
to inform the reader that he is a young lawyer of New-York,
who has preserved, amidst much study and some business,
the natural taste necessary to the enjoyment of country
scenes and country sports. During those weeks of summer
when New-York is deserted, alike by the wearied man of business
and the <i>ennuy&eacute;</i> idler, Mr. Arlington, instead of rushing
with the latter to the overcrowded hotels of Saratoga and Newport,
takes his gun and dog, his pencil and sketch-book, and with
an agreeable companion, or, if this may not be, some choice
books, as a resource against a rainy day, he goes to some wild
spot&mdash;the wilder the better&mdash;where he roves at will from point
to point of interest and beauty, and spends his time in reading,
sketching, and&mdash;alas, for human imperfection!&mdash;shooting.
These vagrant habits first brought him into the neighborhood
of Donaldson Manor, and he had for two successive summers
hunted with the Colonel and sketched with the young ladies,
when he was invited to join their Christmas party in 18&mdash;.
Here I was introduced to him, and in a few days we were the
best friends in the world.</p>

<p>Mr. Arlington's sketch-book, of which I have already spoken,
served to elicit one of our points of sympathy. Bound down
by the iron chain of necessity to that point of space occupied
by my own land, and that point of time filled by my own life,
yet with a heart longing for acquaintance with the beautiful
distant and the noble past, I have ever loved the creations of<a class='page' name ='Page_13' id='Page_13' title='13'>&nbsp;</a>
that art which furnished food to these longings; and as my
fortune has denied me the possession of fine <i>paintings</i>, I have
become somewhat noted in my own little circle for my collection
of fine <i>engravings</i>. Many of these have peculiar charms
for me, from their association, fancied or real, with some place
or person that does interest or has interested me. In the leisure
of a solitary life, it has amused me to append to these
engravings a description of the scenes or a narrative of the
incidents which they suggested to my mind, and for their association
with which I particularly valued them. Annie was
well aware of the existence of these descriptions and narratives,
and, with a pretty despotism which she often exercises over
those she loves, she insisted that I should surrender them to her
for the gratification of the assembled party. One condition
only was I permitted to make in this surrender, and this was,
that Mr. Arlington should also bring forth his portfolio for inspection,
and should describe the <i>locale</i> of the scene sketched,
or relate the circumstances under which the sketches were
made. A pretty <i>ruse</i> this, my gentle Annie, by which you
furnished the artist with an opportunity to display to others
the talents which had charmed yourself. In accordance with
this compact, the drawings, with their accompanying narratives,
were produced, and received with such approbation, that
by the same sweet tyranny which drew them from their hiding-places,
we have been ordered to send this Christmas Guest to
bear the simple stories to other houses, with the hope that
they may give equal pleasure to their inmates.</p>

<p>Merrily blazed the wood fire in the huge old chimney of the
large parlor in which we were accustomed to assemble in the
evening, at Donaldson Manor, and its light was thrown upon
faces bright with good-humored merriment, yet not without
some touch of deeper and more earnest feeling. That party
would of itself have made an interesting picture. There was
Col. Donaldson, tall, gaunt, his figure slightly bent, yet evincing
no feebleness, his curling snow-white locks, his broad bold forehead,
and shaggy brows overhanging eyes beaming with kindness.
Beside him sat Mrs. Donaldson, still beautiful in her
green old age. Her face was usually pale, yet her clear complexion,
and the bright eyes that looked out from beneath the
rich Valenciennes border of her cap, redeemed it from the appearance
of ill health. Her form, stately yet inclining to <i>embonpoint</i>,
was shown to advantage by the soft folds of the rich and
glossy satin dress which ordinarily, at mid-day, took the place
in summer of her cambric morning-dress, and in winter of her
cashmere <i>robe de chambre</i>. Mrs. Donaldson has a piece of
fancy netting which she reserves for her evening work, because,
she says, it does not make much demand upon her eyes.
This the mischievous and privileged Annie calls "Penelope's
Web," declaring, that whatever is done on it in the evening is
undone the next morning. Around the table, on which the
brightest lights were placed for the convenience of those who<a class='page' name ='Page_15' id='Page_15' title='15'>&nbsp;</a>
would read or sew, clustered the two married daughters of the
house&mdash;who always return to their "<i>home</i>," as they still continue
to call Donaldson Manor, for the Christmas holidays&mdash;Annie,
Mr. Arlington, and myself. Miss Donaldson, the eldest
daughter of my worthy friends, is the housekeeper of the
family, and usually sits quietly beside her mother, somewhat
fatigued probably by the active employments of her day. The
two sons of Col. Donaldson, the elder of whom is only twenty-three,
his sons-in-law, and his grandson, Robert Dudley, a fine
lad of twelve, give animation to the scene by moving hither
and thither, now joining our group at the table, now discussing
in a corner the amusements of to-morrow, and now entertaining
us with a graphic account of to-day's adventures, of the
sleighs upset, or the skating-matches won.</p>

<p>Such was the party assembled little more than a week
before Christmas the last year, when Annie called upon Mr.
Arlington and myself to redeem the pledges we had given,
and surrender our portfolios to her. Some slight contention
arose between us on the question who should first contribute
to the entertainment of the company; Mr. Arlington exclaiming
"<i>Place aux Dames</i>," and I contending that there was
great want of chivalry in thus putting a woman into the front
of the battle. This little dispute was terminated by the proposal
that Annie having been blindfolded to secure impartial
justice, the two portfolios should be placed on the table, and
she should choose, not only from which of them our entertainment
should be drawn, but the very subject that should furnish
it. Mr. Arlington vehemently applauded this proposal, and
then urged that he must himself tie the handkerchief, as no
one else, he feared, would make it an effectual blind. Annie
submitted to his demand, though she professed to feel great indignation
at his implied doubt of her honesty. No one else,
we believe, would have taken so much time for the disposal of<a class='page' name ='Page_16' id='Page_16' title='16'>&nbsp;</a>
this screen, or been so careful in the arrangement of the bands
of hair over which, or through which, the handkerchief was
passed; and the touch of no other hand, perhaps, would have
called up so bright a color to the cheeks, and even to the brow,
of our sweet Annie. When permitted to exercise her office,
Annie, to my great pleasure, without an instant's hesitation,
while a mischievous little smile played at the corners of her
mouth, placed her hand on Mr. Arlington's portfolio, and drew
from it a paper, which, on being exhibited, was found to contain
the pencilled outline of many heads grouped together in
various positions, some being apparently elevated considerably
above the others.</p>

<p>"Ah, Miss Annie!" exclaimed Mr. Arlington, with considerable
satisfaction apparent in his voice and manner, "you
must try again, and I think I must trouble you, ladies, for another
handkerchief. This seems to me to have been scarcely
thick enough."</p>

<p>"I appeal to the company," cried Annie, "whether this is
in accordance with Mr. Arlington's engagement. Was he not
to accept any thing I should draw from his portfolio as the
foundation of his sketch?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," was responded from every part of the room.</p>

<p>"But pray, my good friends," persisted Mr. Arlington, "observe
the impossibility of compliance with your demand. How
can I possibly hope to entertain you by any thing based upon
that memento of an idle hour in court, which I should long
ago have destroyed, had I not fancied that I could detect in
those sketchy outlines&mdash;those mere profiles&mdash;very accurate likenesses
of the heads for which they were taken?"</p>

<p>"Those heads look as though they might have histories
attached to them," said Annie, as she bent to examine them
more narrowly.</p>

<p>"Histories indeed they have," said Mr. Arlington.</p>

<p>"Give them to us," suggested Col. Donaldson.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_17' id='Page_17' title='17'>&nbsp;</a>"You have them already. These are all men whose histories
are as well known to the public as to their own families.
There is the elder K&mdash;&mdash;, at once so simple in heart and so
acute in mind. Cannot you read both in his face? There is
his son; and there is D.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;O&mdash;&mdash;, and O.&nbsp;H&mdash;&mdash;, and G&mdash;&mdash;,
and J&mdash;&mdash;. What can I tell you of any of them that you do
not know already?"</p>

<p>"Who are these?" asked Annie, pointing to two heads,
placed somewhat aloof from the rest, and near each other.
"That older face is so benevolent in its expression, and the
younger has so noble a physiognomy, and looks with such
reverence on his companion, that I am persuaded they have a
history beyond that which belongs to the world. Is it not
so?"</p>

<p>"It is. Those are Mr. Cavendish and Herbert Latimer.
They have a history, and I will give it you if you desire it,
though, thus impromptu, I must do it very imperfectly I fear."</p>

<p>"No apologies," said Col. Donaldson. "Begin, and do
your best; no one can do more."</p>

<p>"Than <i>my</i> best," said Mr. Arlington, with a smile, "thank
you. My narrative will have at least one recommendation&mdash;truth&mdash;as
I have received its incidents from Latimer himself."</p>

<p>Without further preliminary, Mr. Arlington commenced
the relation of the following circumstances, which he has since
written out, by Annie's request, at somewhat greater length for
insertion here, giving it the title of</p>


<h3><a name="THE_MAIN_CHANCE" id="THE_MAIN_CHANCE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE MAIN CHANCE.</a></h3>

<p>Herbert Latimer was only twenty when, having passed the
usual examination, he was admitted, by a special act of the
legislative assembly of his native State, to practise at the bar.<a class='page' name ='Page_18' id='Page_18' title='18'>&nbsp;</a>
Young as he was, he had already experienced some of the
severest vicissitudes of life. His father had been a bold, and
for many years a successful merchant, and the young Herbert,
his only child, had been born and nurtured in the lap of wealth
and luxury. He was only sixteen&mdash;a boy&mdash;but a boy full of
the noble aspirations and lofty hopes that make manhood
honorable, when his father died. Mr. Latimer's last illness had
been probably rendered fatal by the intense anxiety of mind he
endured while awaiting intelligence of the result of a mercantile
operation, on which, contrary to the cautious habits of his
earlier years, he had risked well nigh all he possessed. He did
not live to learn that it had completely failed, and that his wife
and child were left with what would have seemed to him the
merest pittance for their support.</p>

<p>The character and talents of young Latimer were well known
to his father's friends, and more than one among them offered
him a clerkship on what could not but be considered as very
advantageous terms. To these offers Herbert listened with
painful indecision. For himself, he would have suffered cheerfully
any privation, rather than relinquish the career which his
inclinations had prompted, and with which were connected all
his glowing visions of the future&mdash;but his mother&mdash;had he a
right to refuse what would enable her to preserve all her
accustomed elegances and indulgences?</p>

<p>"You must be aware, Master Latimer," said he who had
made him the most liberal offers, and who saw him hesitating
on their acceptance, "you must be aware that only my friendship
for your father could induce me to offer such terms to so
young a man, howsoever capable. Three hundred dollars this
year, five hundred the next, if you give satisfaction in the
performance of your duties, a thousand dollars after that till
you are of age, and then a share in the business equal to one-fourth
of its profits&mdash;these are terms, sir, which I would offer to<a class='page' name ='Page_19' id='Page_19' title='19'>&nbsp;</a>
no one else. Your father was a friend to me, sir, and I would
be a friend to his son."</p>

<p>"I feel your kindness and liberality, sir."</p>

<p>"And yet you hesitate?"</p>

<p>"Will you permit me, sir, to ask till to-morrow for consideration?
I must consult my mother."</p>

<p>"That is right, young man; that is right. She knows
something of life, and will, I doubt not, advise you to close
with so unexceptionable an offer."</p>

<p>"Whatever she may advise, sir, be assured I will do."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt then, sir, that I shall see you to-morrow
prepared to take your place in my store. Good morning."</p>

<p>Assuming as cheerful an air as he could, Herbert went from
this interview to his mother's sitting room. Mrs. Latimer
raised her eyes to his as he entered, and reading with a mother's
quick perception the disturbance of his mind, she asked him in
a tone of alarm, "What is the matter, Herbert?"</p>

<p>"Only a very pleasant matter, mother," said Herbert, with
forced cheerfulness, which he endeavored to preserve while
relating the offer just received.</p>

<p>"And would you relinquish the study of the law, Herbert?"
inquired Mrs. Latimer.</p>

<p>"Not if I could help it, mother; but you know Mr. Woodleigh
told you that five hundred dollars a year was the utmost
that he could hope to save for you. If I study law, it must be
several years before I can add any thing to this sum&mdash;I may
even be compelled&mdash;&mdash;" The features of Herbert worked,
tears rushed to his eyes, and he turned away, unable to speak
the thought that distressed him.</p>

<p>"You speak of what can be saved for <i>me</i>, Herbert&mdash;of what
<i>you</i> may be compelled to do. Do you suppose that we can
have separate interests in this question?&mdash;are not your hopes
my hopes&mdash;will not your success, your triumph, be mine too?<a class='page' name ='Page_20' id='Page_20' title='20'>&nbsp;</a>
The only consideration for us, it seems to me, is whether the
profession you have chosen and the prospects open to you in it,
are worth some present sacrifice."</p>

<p>"They are worth every sacrifice on my part&mdash;but you,
mother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have no separate interest from my child&mdash;I have shared
all your hopes, all your aspirations, Herbert, and it would cost
me less to live on bread and water, to dress coarsely, and lodge
hardly for the next five years, than to yield my anticipations of
your future success."</p>

<p>Others had felt <i>for</i> Herbert, and had offered to aid him,
and he had turned from them with a deeper sense of his need
and diminished confidence in his own powers&mdash;his mother felt
<i>with</i> him, and he was cheered and strengthened. The offers
of the friendly merchant were gratefully declined. By the sale
of her jewels, Mrs. Latimer obtained the sum necessary to meet
the expenses incident to her son's first entrance on his professional
studies. She then appropriated three hundred dollars
of their little income to his support in the city, and withdrew
herself to the country, where, she said, the remaining two
hundred would supply all her wants. When Herbert would
have remonstrated against these arrangements, she reminded
him that they were intended to accomplish her own wishes no
less than his. He ceased to remonstrate, but he did what was
better&mdash;he acted&mdash;and the very first year, by self-denying
economy and industry, he was enabled to return to her fifty
dollars of the amount she had allotted to him. The second
year he did better, and the third year Mrs. Latimer was able to
return to the city and board at the same house with her son.
It was only by the joy she expressed at their re-union that
Herbert learned how painful the separation had been to her.
She would not waste his strength and her own in vain
lamentation over a necessary evil. Four years sufficed to<a class='page' name ='Page_21' id='Page_21' title='21'>&nbsp;</a>
prepare Herbert Latimer for his profession, and through the
influence of some of his mother's early friends, exerted at her
earnest request, the legislative act which permitted his entrance
on its duties, was passed. The knowledge of his circumstances
had excited a warm interest for him in many minds, and they
who heard his name for the first time, when he stood before
them for examination, could not but feel prepossessed in favor
of the youth, on whose bold brow deep and lofty thoughts had
left their impress, and in whose grave, earnest eyes the spirit
seer might have read the history of a life of endurance and
silent struggle. All were interested in him&mdash;all evinced that
interest by gentle courtesy of manner&mdash;and almost all seemed
desirous to make his examination as light as possible&mdash;all save
one&mdash;one usually as remarkable for his indulgence to young
aspirants, as for the legal acumen and extensive knowledge,
which had won for him a large share of the profits and honors
of his profession. His associates now wondered to find him so
rigidly exact in his trial of young Latimer's acquirements.</p>

<p>"You were very severe on our young tyro to-day," said a
brother lawyer, and one on whom early associations and similarity
of pursuits, rather than of tastes, had conferred the
privileges of a friend on Mr. Cavendish, as they walked together
from the court-house.</p>

<p>"I saw that he did not need indulgence, and I gave him an
opportunity of proving to others that he did not&mdash;but I had
another and more selfish reason for my rigid test of his
powers."</p>

<p>Mr. Cavendish spoke smilingly, and his friend was emboldened
to ask&mdash;"And pray what selfish motive could you have
for it!"</p>

<p>"I wished to see whether he would suit me as a partner."</p>

<p>"A partner!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;when a man has lived for half a century, he begins<a class='page' name ='Page_22' id='Page_22' title='22'>&nbsp;</a>
to think that he may possibly grow old some day, and I would
provide myself with a young partner, who may take the
laboring oar in my business when age compels me to lay it
aside."</p>

<p>"All that may do very well&mdash;I have some thought of doing
the same myself; but I shall look out for a young man who is
well connected. Connections do a great deal for us, you know,
and we must always have an eye to the main chance."</p>

<p>"I agree with you, but we should probably differ about
what constitutes the main chance."</p>

<p>"There surely can be no difference about that; it means
with every one the one thing needful."</p>

<p>"And what is, in your opinion, the one thing needful?"</p>

<p>"Why this, to be sure," and Mr. Duffield drew his purse
from his pocket, and shook it playfully.</p>

<p>"A somewhat different use of the term from that which the
Bible makes," said Mr. Cavendish.</p>

<p>"Oh! let the Bible alone, and let me hear what you think
of it."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, I cannot let the Bible alone if I tell you my
own opinions, for from the Bible I learned them."</p>

<p>"It seems a strange book, I must say, to consult for a law
of partnerships."</p>

<p>"Had you a better acquaintance with it, Duffield, you
would learn that its principles apply to all the relations of life.
The difference between us is, that when you estimate man's
chief object, or as you call it, his 'main chance,' you take only
the present into view, you leave out of sight altogether the interminable
future, with its higher hopes and deeper interests,
and relations of immeasurably greater importance."</p>

<p>"I find it enough for one poor brain to calculate for the
present."</p>

<p>"A great deal too much you will find it, if you leave out<a class='page' name ='Page_23' id='Page_23' title='23'>&nbsp;</a>
of your sum so important an item as the relations of that present
to the future. Depend on it, Duffield, that he makes the most
for this life, as well as for the next, of his time, his talents, and
his wealth, who uses them as God's steward, for the happiness
of his fellow-creatures, as well as for his own."</p>

<p>"And so, for the happiness of your fellow-creatures, you
are going to give away half of the best practice in the State?"</p>

<p>"I am going to do no such thing. In the first place, I did
not tell you that I was going to offer young Latimer an equal
division of the profits of my practice; and for what I may offer
him I have already taken care to ascertain that he can return
a full equivalent. His talents need only a vantage-ground on
which to act, and I rejoice to be able to give him that which
my own early experience taught me to value."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;we shall see ten years hence how your rule and
mine work. I think I shall offer a partnership to young
Conway&mdash;he is already rising in his profession, and is connected
with some of our wealthiest families."</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;we shall see."</p>

<p>Herbert Latimer had nerved himself to endure five, or it
might be ten more years of profitless toil, ere he should gain a
position which would make his talents available for more than
the mere essentials of existence. Let those who have looked
on so dreary a prospect&mdash;who have buckled on their armor for
such a combat&mdash;judge of the grateful emotion with which he
received the generous proposal of Mr. Cavendish. This proposal,
while it gave him at once an opportunity for the exercise of his
powers, secured to him for the first year one-fifth, for the two
following years one-fourth, and after that, if neither partner
chose to withdraw from the connection, one-half of the profits of
a business, the receipts of which had for several years averaged
over ten thousand dollars. Mr. Cavendish soon found that he
had done well to trust to the gratitude of his young partner for<a class='page' name ='Page_24' id='Page_24' title='24'>&nbsp;</a>
inducing the most active exercise of his powers. Stimulated by
the desire to prove himself not unworthy of such kindness,
and to secure his generous friend from any loss, Herbert
never overlooked aught that could advance the interests, nor
grew weary of any task that could lighten the toil of Mr.
Cavendish.</p>

<p>"Herbert, you really make me ashamed of myself, you are
so constantly busy that I seem idle in comparison," said Mr.
Cavendish, as he prepared one day to lay by his papers and
leave the office at three o'clock. "Pray put away those musty
books, and bring Mrs. Latimer to dine with us&mdash;this is a f&ecirc;te
day with us. My daughter, who has been for two months
with her uncle and aunt in Washington, has returned, and I
want to introduce her to Mrs. Latimer."</p>

<p>"My mother will come to you with pleasure, I am sure."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"Will come too, if I possibly can. You dine at five?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and remember punctuality is the soul of dinner as
well as of business. So do not let the charms of Coke upon
Lyttleton make you forget that fair ladies and hungry gentlemen
are expecting you." Mr. Cavendish closed the door with
a smiling face, and Herbert Latimer turned for another hour to
his books and papers. At a quarter before five he stood with his
mother in the drawing-room of Mr. Cavendish, and received
his first introduction to one who soon became the star of
his life.</p>

<p>Mary Cavendish was not beautiful&mdash;far less could the word
pretty have been applied to her&mdash;but she was lovely. All that
we most love in woman, all pure and peaceful thoughts, all
sweet and gentle affections, seemed to beam from her eyes, or
to sit throned upon her fair and open brow. She had enjoyed
all the advantages, as it is termed, of a fashionable education,
but the influences of her home had been more powerful than<a class='page' name ='Page_25' id='Page_25' title='25'>&nbsp;</a>
those of her school, and she remained what nature had made
her&mdash;a warm-hearted, truthful, generous, and gentle girl&mdash;too
ingenuous for the pretty affectations, too generous for the heartless
coquetries which too often teach us that the <i>accomplished</i>
young lady has sacrificed, for her external refinement, qualities
of a nobler stamp and more delicate beauty. The only
daughter among several children, she was an idol in her home,
and every movement of her life seemed impelled by the desire
to repay the wealth of affection that was lavished upon her.
It was impossible to see such a being daily in the intimacy of
her home associations&mdash;the sphere in which her gentle spirit
shone most brightly&mdash;without loving her; and Herbert soon
felt that he loved her, yet he added in his thoughts "in all
honor," and to him it would have seemed little honorable to
attempt to win this priceless treasure from him to whose generosity
he had owed his place in her circle. Mrs. Latimer,
though she did not fear for her son's honor, trembled for his
future peace as she marked the sadness which often stole over
him, after spending an hour in the society of this lovely girl;
but Mrs. Latimer was a wise woman&mdash;she knew that speech is
to such emotions often as the lighted match to a magazine, and
she kept silence.</p>

<p>For almost a year after his introduction, Herbert continued
in daily intercourse with Mary Cavendish to drink fresh draughts
of love, yet so carefully did he guard his manner, that no suspicion
of his warmer emotions threw a shadow over her friendship,
or checked the frankness with which she unveiled to him
the rich treasures of her mind and heart. It was in the autumn
succeeding their first acquaintance that Mr. and Mrs.
Cavendish issued cards for a large party at their house. It
would be too gay a scene for the quiet taste of Mrs. Latimer,
but Herbert would be there, and at the request of Mrs. Cavendish
he promised to come early. The promise was kept. He<a class='page' name ='Page_26' id='Page_26' title='26'>&nbsp;</a>
arrived half an hour at least before any other guest, bringing
with him a bouquet of rare and beautiful flowers for Mary.
As he entered the hall he heard a slight scream from the parlor
beside whose open door he stood. The scream was in a
voice to whose lightest tone his heart responded, and in an instant,
he was beside Mary Cavendish, had clasped her in his
arms, and pressing her closely to his person, was endeavoring
to extinguish with his hands the flames that enveloped her.
The evening was cold: there was a fire in the stove, before
which Mary stood arranging some flowers on the mantel-piece,
when the door was opened for him. The sudden rush of air
had wafted her light, floating drapery of gauze and lace into
the fire, and in a moment all was in a blaze. Fortunate was
it for her, that under this light, flimsy drapery, was worn a
dress of stouter texture and less combustible material&mdash;a rich
satin. After the slight scream which had brought him to her
side, Mary uttered no sound, and with his whole soul concentrated
on action, he had been equally silent till the last spark
was smothered. Then gazing wildly in her pallid face he exclaimed,
"In mercy speak to me! Did I come too late? Are
you burned?"</p>

<p>"I scarcely know&mdash;I think not," she faltered out. Then,
as she made an effort to withdraw from his arms, added
quickly&mdash;"no&mdash;not at all."</p>

<p>Completely overpowered by the revulsion of feeling which
those words occasioned, Herbert clasped her again in his arms,
and fervently ejaculating, "Thank God!" pressed his lips to
her cheek. At that moment, the voice of Mr. Cavendish was
heard in the next room, and breaking from him, Mary rushed
to her astonished father, and burying her face in his bosom,
burst into tears. Aroused to full consciousness by the presence
of another, Herbert stood trembling and dismayed at the remembrance
of his own rashness. Agitated as she was, Mary<a class='page' name ='Page_27' id='Page_27' title='27'>&nbsp;</a>
was compelled to answer her father's questions, for he seemed
wholly unable to speak.</p>

<p>"Latimer, I owe my child's life probably to you. How
shall I repay the debt?" cried Mr. Cavendish, attempting, as
he spoke, to clasp Herbert's hand. He winced at the touch,
and a sudden contraction passed over his face.</p>

<p>"You are burned," said Mr. Cavendish, and would have
examined his hand, but throwing his handkerchief over it,
Herbert declared it was not worth mentioning, though at the
same time he confessed that the pain was sufficient to make
him desirous to return home, and have some soothing application
made to it. Mr. Cavendish parted from him with regret,
with earnest charges that he should take care of himself, and
equally earnest hopes that he might be sufficiently relieved to
return to them before the evening was passed; but Mary still
lay in her father's arms, with her face hidden, and noticed
Herbert's departure neither by word nor look.</p>

<p>"I have outraged her delicacy, and she cannot bear even
to see me," he said to himself.</p>

<p>In passing out he accidentally trod on the flowers which he
had selected with such care&mdash;"Crushed like my own heart!"
he ejaculated mentally.</p>

<p>A fortnight passed before Herbert Latimer could take his accustomed
place in the office of Mr. Cavendish. His hand had
been deeply burned&mdash;so deeply that the pain had produced
fever. During this period of suffering, Mr. Cavendish had often
visited him, and Mrs. Cavendish had more than once taken his
mother's place at his bedside; but Herbert found little pleasure
in their attentions, for he said to himself, "If they knew
all my presumption, they would be less kind."</p>

<p>His illness passed away, his hand healed, and he resumed
his accustomed avocations; but no invitation, however urgent,
could win him again to the house of Mr. Cavendish. "I have<a class='page' name ='Page_28' id='Page_28' title='28'>&nbsp;</a>
proved my own weakness&mdash;I will not place myself again in the
way of temptation," was the language of his heart. Apologies
became awkward. He felt that he must seem to his friend ungracious
if not ungrateful; and one day observing unusual seriousness
in the countenance of Mr. Cavendish on his declining
an invitation to dine with him, he exclaimed, "You look displeased,
and I can hardly wonder at it; but could you know
my reason for denying myself the pleasure of visiting you, I am
sure you would think me right."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so; but as I do not know it, you cannot
be surprised that your determined withdrawal from our circle
should wound both my feelings and those of my family."</p>

<p>Herbert covered his eyes with his hand for a moment, and
then turning them with a grave and even sad expression on
Mr. Cavendish, said, "I have declined your invitations only
because I could not accept them with honor: I love your
daughter&mdash;I have loved her almost from the first hour of my
acquaintance with her."</p>

<p>"And why have you not told me so before, Herbert?"
asked Mr. Cavendish, with no anger in his tones.</p>

<p>"Because I believed myself capable of loving in silence, and
while I wronged no one, I was willing to indulge in the sweet
poison of her society; but a moment of danger to her destroyed
my self-control. What has been may be again&mdash;I have
learned to distrust myself&mdash;I cannot tamper with temptation,
lest I should one day use the position in which you have
placed me, and the advantages which you have bestowed on
me, in endeavoring to win from you a treasure which you may
well be reluctant to yield to me."</p>

<p>"Herbert, I only blame you for not having spoken to me
sooner of this."</p>

<p>"I feel now that I should have done so&mdash;it was a want of<a class='page' name ='Page_29' id='Page_29' title='29'>&nbsp;</a>
self-knowledge, the rash confidence of one untried which kept
me silent."</p>

<p>"No, Herbert&mdash;it was a want of knowledge of me&mdash;of
confidence in my justice&mdash;I will not say my kindness. What
higher views do you suppose I can entertain for my daughter,
than to make her the wife of one who has a prospect of
obtaining the most distinguished eminence in my own profession."</p>

<p>"If that prospect be mine, to you I owe it&mdash;could I make
it a plea for asking more?"</p>

<p>"You owe what I did for you to the interest and esteem
excited by your own qualities, and all I did has only given you
a place for the exercise of those qualities&mdash;I do not know how
you will win Mary's forgiveness for refraining from her society
on such slight grounds."</p>

<p>"Dare I hope for your permission to seek that forgiveness?"</p>

<p>"Dare I hope for your company to dinner to-day?"</p>

<p>"Now that you know all, nothing could give so much
pleasure&mdash;though I fear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, fearing again!"</p>

<p>"I fear that Miss Cavendish is very much displeased with me."</p>

<p>"For saving her life?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not exactly that."</p>

<p>Herbert Latimer did not confide the cause of his fear to Mr.
Cavendish, neither did he suffer it to interfere with his visit on
that day. He went to dinner, but stayed to tea, and long after,
and as Mary was his companion for much, if not all of this
time, we presume that her displeasure could not have been
manifested in any very serious manner.</p>

<p>It was about six weeks after this renewal of his visits that
Mr. Duffield meeting his friend Mr. Cavendish one morning,
accosted him with, "I hear that your daughter is going to be
married to young Latimer&mdash;is it true?"</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_30' id='Page_30' title='30'>&nbsp;</a>"Yes, and I heartily wish the affair were over, for I hope
Herbert will recover his senses when he is actually married, as
now I am obliged to attend to his business and my own too."</p>

<p>"Not much profit in that, I should think&mdash;I manage somewhat
differently."</p>

<p>"Did you not tell me that you intended forming a partnership
with young Conway?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but before I had done so, I heard that Sprague,
who is as well connected as Conway, and a great deal more
industrious, would go into business with me on less exacting
terms. He has been associated with me for some time. He
does all the drudgery of the business, and is content with one-eighth
of the profits for five years."</p>

<p>"Those are low terms&mdash;with talent and connection too, I
should think he could have done better."</p>

<p>"Why, you see his connections were of little use to him
while he was alone, for he was so desperately poor that they
did not like to acknowledge him, but I knew as soon as he
began to rise they would all notice him, and so it has proved.
I have no doubt I shall gain through them more than the
thousand dollars a-year which Sprague will draw, while I shall
be saved every thing that is really disagreeable or laborious in
my practice; and you give two thousand dollars a-year, and
are to have your daughter married to a gentleman who leaves
all the business on your hands&mdash;which of us, do you think, has
attended most successfully to the main chance?"</p>

<p>"According to my views of the main chance, it is not to be
determined by such data&mdash;but even in your own view we may
have a very different account to render nine years hence?"</p>

<p>"Ah, well! Ten years from the day that Latimer passed we
will compare notes."</p>

<p>Ten years are long in prospective, but it seemed to both
parties only a short time when the appointed anniversary came.<a class='page' name ='Page_31' id='Page_31' title='31'>&nbsp;</a>
On that day Mr. Cavendish invited several of his brother
lawyers, and amongst them Mr. Duffield, to dinner. Herbert
Latimer, his wife and mother, his two noble boys, and though
last, not least in importance, if in size, his little girl, her grandfather's
especial pet, were of the party. It was a well assorted
party. The guests found good cheer and social converse&mdash;the
cherished friends of the house, food for deeper and higher enjoyment
When the ladies had withdrawn, calling Herbert
Latimer to the head of the table, Mr. Cavendish seated himself
beside Mr. Duffield.</p>

<p>"Well, Duffield!" he exclaimed, "do you know that it is
ten years to-day since Herbert Latimer stood before us for
examination?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" ejaculated Mr. Duffield, in the tone of one who did
not care to pursue the subject further.</p>

<p>"You remember our agreement&mdash;are you still willing to
make our success in that time a test of the truth of our
respective principles?"</p>

<p>"It may afford a more conclusive proof of your better
judgment in the selection of an associate."</p>

<p>"Sprague stands very high in his profession."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I knew he would, for he has talent and connection&mdash;therefore
I chose him; but he left me just at the time these
were beginning to be available, as soon as the five years for
which our agreement was made, had expired."</p>

<p>"What occasioned his leaving you?"</p>

<p>"Why, Duval offered him better terms than I had done&mdash;I
should not have cared so much for his going, but he carried
off many of my clients, with whom he had ingratiated himself
during his connection with me. My practice has scarcely recovered
yet from the injury which he did it."</p>


<p>"He seems to have acted on your own principle, and to
have considered the main chance to mean the most money."</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_32' id='Page_32' title='32'>&nbsp;</a>"And do you suppose Latimer would have remained with
you if he could have made better terms for himself?"</p>

<p>"I know that during my long illness he was offered double
what he was receiving, or could then hope ever to receive from
my practice, and his reply to the offer was that the bonds
forged by gratitude and affection, no interest could break. He
has now built up the business again to far more than it was
when he joined me&mdash;I know that I owe most of it to him, yet
he will not listen to any advice to dissolve our partnership.
Gentlemen," he said, "I have a sentiment to propose to you,
which you may drink in wine or water as you like best.
'<span class="smcap">The Main Chance</span>&mdash;always best secured by obedience to the
golden rule&mdash;as ye would that others should do unto you, do
ye even so to them.'"</p>

<p>The morning after Mr. Arlington had commenced our Christmas
entertainments with the sketch of his friend Herbert Latimer's
life, was dark and gloomy. At least, such was its aspect abroad,
where leaden clouds covered the sky, and a cold, sleety rain
fell fast; but within, all was bright, and warm, and cheerful.
Immediately after breakfast we separated, each in search of
amusement suited to his or her own tastes: some to the music
room, some to the library, and Robert Dudley and Annie Donaldson
to a game of battledore and shuttlecock in the wide hall, with
Mr. Arlington for a spectator. As the storm increased, however,
all seemed to feel the want of companionship, and without any
preconcerted plan, we found ourselves, about two hours after
breakfast, again assembled in the room in which quiet, patient
Mrs. Donaldson sat, ravelling the netting of the last evening.</p>

<p>"Now for Aunt Nancy's portfolio," cried Annie, as soon as
conversation began to flag.</p>

<p>The proposal was seconded so warmly that, as I could urge
nothing against it, the portfolio was immediately produced, and
Annie, taking possession of it, commissioned Robert Dudley to
draw forth an engraving:&mdash;"Scene, a chamber by night, a
sleeping baby and a sleepy mother, a basket of needle-work&mdash;I
am sure it is needle-work&mdash;on the floor, and a cross suspended<a class='page' name ='Page_34' id='Page_34' title='34'>&nbsp;</a>
from the wall," said Annie, describing the engraving which she
had taken from Robert.</p>

<p>"That cross looks promising," said Colonel Donaldson, who
likes a little romance as well as any of his daughters. "Let us
have the fair lady's history, Aunt Nancy."</p>

<p>"I know nothing about her," said I, with a smile at his
eagerness.</p>

<p>"Then why, dear Aunt Nancy, did you keep the engraving?"
asked Annie.</p>

<p>"I might answer, because of my interest in the scene it
depicts&mdash;a scene in which religion seems to shed its sanctifying
influence over the tenderest affection and the homeliest duties of
our common life; but I had another reason."</p>

<p>"Ah! I knew it," exclaimed Annie.</p>

<p>"I first saw this print in company with a very cultivated and
interesting German lady, to whose memory the sleeping baby
recalled a cradle song written by her countryman, the brave
K&ouml;rner. She sang it for me, and as the German is, I am
grieved to say, a sealed book to me, she gave me a literal translation
of the words, which&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which you have put into English verse, and written here
at the back of the engraving in the finest of all fine writing,
and which papa will put on his spectacles and read for us."</p>

<p>"No; I commission Mr. Arlington to do that," said the
Colonel, "without his spectacles."</p>

<p>"First," said I, "let me assure you that the original is
full of a simple, natural tenderness, which I fear, in the
double process of translating and versifying, has entirely escaped."</p>

<p>Mr. Arlington, taking the paper from Annie, now read,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Poor K&ouml;rner!" said Mr. Arlington, as he concluded reading
this song&mdash;if indeed it may claim that name in its English
dress&mdash;"I can sympathize, as few can do, with his mournful
memory of mother-love."</p>

<p>This was said in a tone of such genuine emotion, that I
looked at him with even more pleasure than I had hitherto
done.</p>

<p>"Such tenderness touches us particularly when found, as in
K&ouml;rner, in union with manly and vigorous qualities&mdash;perhaps,
because it is a rare combination," said Mrs. Dudley.</p>

<p>"Is it rare?" I asked doubtfully. "The results of my own
observation have led me to believe that it is precisely in manly,
vigorous, independent minds that we see the fullest development
of our simple, natural, home-affections."</p>

<p>"You are right, Aunt Nancy," said Col. Donaldson; "it is
only boys striving to seem manly and men of boyish minds,
who fail to acknowledge with reverence and tenderness the
value of a mother's love."</p>

<p>"So convinced am I of this," I replied, "that I would ask
for no more certain indication of a man's nobility of nature,
than his manner to his mother. I remember a striking illustration
of the fidelity of such an indication in two brothers
of the name of Manning, with whom I was once acquainted.
The one was quite a <i>petit-ma&icirc;tre</i>&mdash;a dandy; the other, a fine
creature&mdash;large-minded and large-hearted. The first betrayed
in every look and movement, that he considered himself greatly<a class='page' name ='Page_37' id='Page_37' title='37'>&nbsp;</a>
his mother's superior, and feared every moment that she should
detract from his dignity by some sin against the dicta of fashion;
the other did honor at once to her and to himself, by his
reverent devotion to her. They were a contrast, and a contrast
which circumstances brought out most strikingly. Ah, Mr.
Arlington! I wish you could have seen them&mdash;a sketch of them
from your pencil would have been a picture indeed."</p>

<p>"We will take your word-painting instead," said Mr.
Arlington.</p>

<p>"A mere description in words could not present them to
you in all their strongly marked diversity of character. To do
this, I must give you a history of their lives."</p>

<p>"And why not?"&mdash;and&mdash;"Oh, yes, Aunt Nancy, that is
just what we want," was echoed from one to another. They
consented to delay their gratification till the evening, that I
might have a little time to arrange my reminiscences; and
when "the hours of long uninterrupted evening" came, and we
had</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&mdash;&mdash;stirr'd the fire and closed the shutters fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let fall the curtains, wheeled the sofa round,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and disposed ourselves in comfort for talking and for listening,
I gave them the relation which you will find below under the
title of</p>


<h3><a name="THE_BROTHERS" id="THE_BROTHERS"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE BROTHERS;</a></h3>

<h4>OR, IN THE FASHION AND ABOVE THE FASHION.</h4>

<p>"Some men are born to greatness&mdash;some achieve greatness&mdash;and
some have greatness thrust upon them." Henry Manning
belonged to the second of these three great classes. The son of
a mercantile adventurer, who won and lost a fortune by speculation,
he found himself at sixteen years of age called on to
choose between the life of a Western farmer, with its vigorous<a class='page' name ='Page_38' id='Page_38' title='38'>&nbsp;</a>
action, stirring incident and rough usage&mdash;and the life of a
clerk in one of the most noted establishments in Broadway, the
great source and centre of fashion in New-York. Mr. Morgan,
the brother of Mrs. Manning, who had been recalled from the distant
West by the death of her husband, and the embarrassments
into which that event had plunged her, had obtained the offer
of the latter situation for one of his two nephews, and would
take the other with him to his prairie-home.</p>

<p>"I do not ask you to go with me, Matilda," he said to his
sister, "because our life is yet too wild and rough to suit a delicate
woman, reared, as you have been, in the midst of luxurious
refinements. The difficulties and privations of life in the West
fall most heavily upon woman, while she has little of that sustaining
power which man's more adventurous spirit finds in
overcoming difficulty and coping with danger. But let me
have one of your boys; and by the time he has arrived at manhood,
he will be able, I doubt not, to offer you in his home all
the comforts, if not all the elegances of your present abode."</p>

<p>Mrs. Manning consented; and now the question was, which
of her sons should remain with her, and which should accompany
Mr. Morgan. To Henry Manning, older by two years
than his brother George, the choice of situations was submitted.
He went with his uncle to the Broadway establishment,
heard the duties which would be demanded from him, the salary
which would be given, saw the grace with which the <i>&eacute;l&eacute;gants</i>
behind the counter displayed their silks, and satins, and velvets,
to the <i>&eacute;l&eacute;gantes</i> before the counter, and the decision with which
they promulgated the decrees of fashion; and with that just
sense of his own powers, which is the accompaniment of true
genius, he decided at once that there lay his vocation. George,
who had not been without difficulty kept quiet, while his brother
was forming his decision, as soon as it was announced,
sprang forward with a whoop that would have suited a West<a class='page' name ='Page_39' id='Page_39' title='39'>&nbsp;</a>ern
forest better than a New-York drawing-room, threw the
Horace he was reading across the table, clasped first his mother
and then his uncle in his arms, and exclaimed, "I am the boy
for the West. I will help you fell forests and build cities there,
uncle. Why should not we build cities as well as Romulus and
Remus?"</p>

<p>"I will supply your cities with all their silks, and satins, and
velvets, and laces, and charge them nothing, George," said
Henry Manning, with that air of superiority with which the
worldly-wise often look on the sallies of the enthusiast.</p>

<p>"You make my head ache, my son," complained Mrs. Manning,
shrinking from his boisterous gratulation;&mdash;but Mr. Morgan
returned his hearty embrace, and as he gazed into his bold,
bright face, with an eye as bright as his own, replied to his
burst of enthusiasm, "You <i>are</i> the very boy for the West,
George. It is out of such brave stuff that pioneers and city-builders
are always made."</p>

<p>Henry Manning soon bowed himself into the favor of the
ladies who formed the principal customers of his employer. By
his careful and really correct habits, and his elegant taste in the
selection and arrangement of goods, he became also a favorite
with his employers themselves. They needed an agent for the
selection of goods abroad, and they sent him. He purchased
cloths for them in England, and silks in France, and came home
with the reputation of a travelled man. Having persuaded his
mother to advance a capital for him by selling out the bank
stock in which Mr. Morgan had founded her little fortune, at
twenty-four years of age he commenced business for himself as
a French importer. Leaving a partner to attend to the sales at
home, he went abroad for the selection of goods, and the further
enhancement of his social reputation. He returned in two
years with a fashionable figure, a most <i>recherch&eacute;</i> style of dress,
moustachios of the most approved cut, and whiskers of faultless<a class='page' name ='Page_40' id='Page_40' title='40'>&nbsp;</a>
curl&mdash;a finished gentleman in his own conceit. With such attractions,
the <i>prestige</i> which he derived from his reported travels
and long residence abroad, and the <i>savoir faire</i> of one who had
made the conventional arrangements of society his study, he
quickly arose to the summit of his wishes, to the point which
it had been his life's ambition to attain. He became the umpire
of taste, and his word was received as the fiat of fashion.
He continued to reside with his mother, and paid great attention
to her style of dress, and the arrangements of her house,
for it was important that his mother should appear properly.
Poor Mrs. Manning! she sometimes thought that proud title
dearly purchased by listening to his daily criticisms on appearance,
language, manners, which had been esteemed stylish
enough in their day.</p>

<p>George Manning had visited his mother only once since he
left her with all the bright imaginings and boundless confidence
of fourteen, and then Henry was in Europe. It was during
the first winter after his return, and when the brothers had been
separated for nearly twelve years, that Mrs. Manning informed
him she had received a letter from George, announcing his intention
to be in New-York in December, and to remain with
them through most if not all of the winter. Henry Manning
was evidently annoyed at the announcement.</p>

<p>"I wish," he said, "that George had chosen to make his
visit in the summer, when most of the people to whom I should
hesitate to introduce him would have been absent. I should be
sorry to hurt his feelings, but really, to introduce a Western farmer
into polished society&mdash;" Henry Manning shuddered, and
was silent. "And then to choose this winter of all winters for
his visit, and to come in December, just at the very time that I
heard yesterday Miss Harcourt was coming from Washington
to spend a few weeks with her friend, Mrs. Duffield!"</p>

<p>"And what has Miss Harcourt's visit to Mrs. Duffield to do
with George's visit to us?" asked Mrs. Manning.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_41' id='Page_41' title='41'>&nbsp;</a>"A great deal&mdash;at least it has a great deal to do with my
regret that he should come just now. I told you how I became
acquainted with Emma Harcourt in Europe, and what a splendid
creature she is. Even in Paris, she bore the palm for wit
and beauty&mdash;and fashion too&mdash;that is in English and American
society. But I did not tell you that she received me with such
distinguished favor, and evinced so much pretty consciousness
at my attentions, that had not her father, having been chosen
one of the electors of President and Vice-President, hurried from
Paris in order to be in this country in time for his vote, I should
probably have been induced to marry her. Her father is in
Congress this year, and you see, she no sooner learns that I am
here, than she comes to spend part of the winter with a friend
in New-York."</p>

<p>Henry arose at this, walked to a glass, surveyed his elegant
figure, and continuing to cast occasional glances at it as he
walked backwards and forwards through the room, resumed the
conversation, or rather his own communication.</p>

<p>"All this is very encouraging, doubtless; but Emma Harcourt
is so perfectly elegant, so thoroughly refined, that I dread
the effect upon her of any <i>outr&eacute;</i> association&mdash;by the by, mother,
if I obtain her permission to introduce you to her, you will
not wear that brown hat in visiting her&mdash;a brown hat is my
aversion&mdash;it is positively vulgar&mdash;but to return to George&mdash;how
can I introduce him, with his rough, boisterous, Western
manner, to this courtly lady?&mdash;the very thought chills me"&mdash;and
Henry Manning shivered&mdash;"and yet, how can I avoid it,
if we should be engaged?"</p>

<p>With December came the beautiful Emma Harcourt, and
Mrs. Duffield's house was thronged with her admirers. Hers
was the form and movement of the Huntress Queen rather than
of one trained in the halls of fashion. There was a joyous freedom
in her air, her step, her glance, which, had she been less<a class='page' name ='Page_42' id='Page_42' title='42'>&nbsp;</a>
beautiful, less talented, less fortunate in social position or in
wealth, would have placed her under the ban of fashion; but,
as it was, she commanded fashion, and even Henry Manning,
the very slave of conventionalism, had no criticism for her. He
had been among the first to call on her, and the blush that
flitted across her cheek, the smile that played upon her lips, as
he was announced, might well have flattered one even of less
vanity.</p>

<p>The very next day, before Henry had had time to improve
these symptoms in her favor, on returning home, at five o'clock,
to his dinner, he found a stranger in the parlor with his mother.
The gentleman arose on his entrance, and he had scarcely time
to glance at the tall, manly form, the lofty air, the commanding
brow, ere he found himself clasped in his arms, with the
exclamation, "Dear Henry! how rejoiced I am to see you
again."</p>

<p>In George Manning the physical and intellectual man had
been developed in rare harmony. He was taller and larger
every way than his brother Henry, and the self-reliance which
the latter had laboriously attained from the mastery of all conventional
rules, was his by virtue of a courageous soul, which
held itself above all rules but those prescribed by its own high
sense of the right. There was a singular contrast, rendered yet
more striking by some points of resemblance, between the pupil
of society, and the child of the forest&mdash;between the Parisian
elegance of Henry, and the proud, free grace of George. His
were the step and bearing which we have seen in an Indian
chief; but thought had left its impress on his brow, and there
was in his countenance that indescribable air of refinement
which marks a polished mind. In a very few minutes Henry
became reconciled to his brother's arrival, and satisfied with
him in all respects but one&mdash;his dress. This was of the finest
cloth, but made into large, loose trowsers, and a species of hunt<a class='page' name ='Page_43' id='Page_43' title='43'>&nbsp;</a>ing-shirt,
trimmed with fur, belted around the waist, and descending
to the knee, instead of the tight pantaloons and closely
fitting body coat prescribed by fashion. The little party lingered
long over the table&mdash;it was seven o'clock before they
arose from it.</p>

<p>"Dear mother," said George Manning, "I am sorry to leave
you this evening, but I will make you rich amends to-morrow
by introducing to you the friend I am going to visit, if you will
permit me. Henry, it is so long since I was in New-York that
I need some direction in finding my way&mdash;must I turn up or
down Broadway for Number&mdash;, in going from this street?"</p>

<p>"Number&mdash;," exclaimed Henry in surprise; "you must
be mistaken&mdash;that is Mrs. Duffield's."</p>

<p>"Then I am quite right, for it is at Mrs. Duffield's that I
expect to meet my friend this evening."</p>

<p>With some curiosity to know what friend of George could
have so completely the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> of the fashionable Mrs. Duffield's
house as to make an appointment there, Henry proposed to go
with him and show him the way. There was a momentary
hesitation in George's manner before he replied, "Very well, I
shall be obliged to you."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;excuse me George&mdash;you are not surely going in that
dress&mdash;this is one of Mrs. Duffield's reception evenings, and,
early as it is, you will find company there."</p>

<p>George laughed as he replied; "They must take me as I
am, Henry. We do not receive our fashions from Paris at the
West."</p>

<p>Henry almost repented his offer to accompany his brother;
but it was too late to withdraw, for George, unconscious of this
feeling, had taken his cloak and cap, and was awaiting his escort.
As they approached Mrs. Duffield's house, George, who
had hitherto led the conversation, became silent, or answered
his brother only in monosyllables, and then not always to the<a class='page' name ='Page_44' id='Page_44' title='44'>&nbsp;</a>
purpose. As they entered the hall, the hats and cloaks displayed
there showed that, as Henry supposed, they were not
the earliest visitors. George paused for a moment and said,
"You must go in without me, Henry. Show me to a room
where there is no company," he continued, turning to a servant&mdash;"and
take this card in to Mrs. Duffield&mdash;be sure to give it
to Mrs. Duffield herself."</p>

<p>The servant bowed low to the commanding stranger; and
Henry, almost mechanically, obeyed his direction, muttering to
himself, "Free and easy, upon my honor." He had scarcely
entered the usual reception-room and made his bow to Mrs.
Duffield, when the servant presented his brother's card. He
watched her closely, and saw a smile playing over her lips as
her eyes rested on it. She glanced anxiously at Miss Harcourt,
and crossing the room to a group in which she stood, she drew
her aside. After a few whispered words, Mrs. Duffield placed
the card in Miss Harcourt's hand. A sudden flash of joy irradiated
every feature of her beautiful face, and Henry Manning
saw that, but for Mrs. Duffield's restraining hand, she would
have rushed from the room. Recalled thus to a recollection of
others, she looked around her, and her eyes met his. In an
instant, her face was covered with blushes, and she drew back
with embarrassed consciousness&mdash;almost immediately, however,
she raised her head with a proud, bright expression, and though
she did not look at Henry Manning, he felt that she was conscious
of his observation, as she passed with a composed yet
joyous step from the room.</p>

<p>Henry Manning was awaking from a dream. It was not
a very pleasant awakening, but as his vanity rather than his
heart was touched, he was able to conceal his chagrin, and appear
as interesting and agreeable as usual. He now expected
with some impatience the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of the comedy. An
hour passed away, and Mrs. Duffield's eye began to consult the<a class='page' name ='Page_45' id='Page_45' title='45'>&nbsp;</a>
marble clock on her mantel-piece. The chime for another half-hour
rang out; and she left the room and returned in a few
minutes, leaning on the arm of George Manning.</p>

<p>"Who is that?&mdash;What noble-looking man is that?" were
questions Henry Manning heard from many&mdash;from a very few
only the exclamation, "How oddly he is dressed!" Before the
evening was over Henry began to feel that he was eclipsed on
his own theatre&mdash;that George, if not <i>in the fashion</i>, was yet
more <i>the fashion</i> than he.</p>

<p>Following the proud, happy glance of his brother's eye, a
quarter of an hour later, Henry saw Miss Harcourt entering the
room in an opposite direction from that in which she had lately
come. If this was a <i>ruse</i> on her part to veil the connection
between their movements, it was a fruitless caution. None who
had seen her before could fail now to observe the softened
character of her beauty, and those who saw</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A thousand blushing apparitions start<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into her face"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>whenever his eyes rested on her, could scarcely doubt his influence
over her.</p>

<p>The next morning George Manning brought Miss Harcourt
to visit his mother; and Mrs. Manning rose greatly in her son
Henry's estimation, when he saw the affectionate deference
evinced towards her by the proud beauty.</p>

<p>"How strange my manner must have seemed to you sometimes!"
said Miss Harcourt to Henry one day. "I was engaged
to George long before I met you in Europe; and though
I never had courage to mention him to you, I wondered a little
that you never spoke of him. I never doubted for a moment
that you were acquainted with our engagement."</p>

<p>"I do not even yet understand where and how you and
George met."</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_46' id='Page_46' title='46'>&nbsp;</a>"We met at home&mdash;my father was Governor of the Territory&mdash;State
now&mdash;in which your uncle lives: our homes were
very near each other's, and so we met almost daily while I was
still a child. We have had all sorts of adventures together; for
George was a great favorite with my father, and I was permitted
to go with him anywhere. He has saved my life twice&mdash;once
at the imminent peril of his own, when with the wilfulness
of a spoiled child I would ride a horse which he told me I
could not manage. Oh! you know not half his nobleness," and
tears moistened the bright eyes of the happy girl.</p>

<p>Henry Manning was touched through all his conventionalism,
yet the moment after he said, "George is a fine fellow,
certainly; but I wish you could persuade him to dress a
little more like other people."</p>

<p>"I would not if I could," exclaimed Emma Harcourt, while
the blood rushed to her temples; "fashions and all such conventional
regulations are made for those who have no innate
perception of the right, the noble, the beautiful&mdash;not for such
as he&mdash;he is above fashion."</p>

<p>What Emma would not ask, she yet did not fail to recognize
as another proof of correct judgment, when George
Manning laid aside his Western costume and assumed one less
remarkable.</p>

<p>Henry Manning had received a new idea&mdash;that there are
those who are above the fashion. Allied to this was another
thought, which in time found entrance to his mind, that it
would be at least as profitable to devote our energies to the
acquisition of true nobility of soul, pure and high thought and
refined taste, as to the study of those conventionalisms which
are but their outer garment, and can at best only conceal for a
short time their absence.</p>

<p>The next day was brilliant. Snow had fallen during the night,
and the sun, which arose without a cloud, was reflected back
from it with dazzling brightness, while every branch and spray
glittered in its casing of ice as though it had been a huge
diamond. Before we met at breakfast, the younger members
of the party had decided on a sleigh-ride. Even Col. Donaldson
<i>malgr&eacute;</i> old age and rheumatism, found himself unable to resist
the cheerful morning and their gay solicitations, and accompanied
them. Mrs. Donaldson and I were left alone, a
circumstance which did not afflict either of us. Mrs. Donaldson
was never at a loss for pleasant occupation for her hours, and
Annie had given me something to do in parting.</p>

<p>"Remember, Aunt Nancy, we shall look to you for our
entertainment this evening; you shall be permitted to choose
your subject. Is not that gracious?" she added, with a laugh
at her own style of command, springing at the same moment
from the sleigh in which Mr. Arlington had already placed
himself at her side, and running up the steps to the piazza,
where I stood, that she might give me another kiss, and satisfy
herself that she had not wounded the <i>amour propre</i> of her old
friend, by speaking so much <i>en reine</i>. I was, in truth, pleased
to be reminded of the demand which might be made on me in
the evening, while I had time to glance over sketches intended<a class='page' name ='Page_48' id='Page_48' title='48'>&nbsp;</a>
only for myself, and ascertain whether they contained any thing
likely to interest others.</p>

<p>A late dinner re-united us, and the fatigues of the morning
having been repaired by an hour's rest in the afternoon, our
party was more than usually fresh and ready for enjoyment
when we met in the evening. I had availed myself of Annie's
permission, and selected my subject. It was a crayon sketch of
a lovely lake, taken by Philip Oswald, the son of one of my
most valued friends. The sketch was made while all around
remained in the wilderness of uncultivated nature. Since that
day, the stillness has been disturbed by the sound of the axe and
the hammer. Upon the borders of that sweet lake, a fair home
has risen, from which the incense of grateful and loving hearts
has gone up to the Creator of so much beauty. The associations
which made this scene peculiarly interesting to me I
had long since written out, and now give to the reader under
the title of</p>


<h3><a name="LOSS_AND_GAIN" id="LOSS_AND_GAIN"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">LOSS AND GAIN;</a></h3>

<h4>OR, HEARTS VERSUS DIAMONDS.</h4>

<p>Winter had thrown its icy fetters over the Hudson, and stilled
even the stormier waves of the East River, as the inhabitants
of New-York designate that portion of the Harbor which lies
between their city and Brooklyn. The city itself&mdash;its streets&mdash;its
houses&mdash;all wore the livery of this "ruler of the inverted
year"&mdash;while in many a garret and cellar of its crowded streets,
ragged children huddled together, seeking to warm their frozen
limbs beneath the scanty covering of their beds, or cowering
over the few half-dying embers, which they misnamed a fire.
Yet the social affections were not chilled&mdash;rather did they seem
to glow more warmly, as though rejoicing in their triumph
over the mighty conqueror of the physical world. Christian<a class='page' name ='Page_49' id='Page_49' title='49'>&nbsp;</a>
charity went forth unchecked through the frosty air and over
the snow-clad streets, to shelter the houseless, to clothe the
naked, to warm the freezing. Human sympathies awoke to
new-life, the dying hopes and failing energies of man; and the
sleigh-bells, ringing out their joyous peals through the day, and
far, far into the night, told that the young and fair were abroad
braving all the severities of the season, in their eager search
after pleasure. In the neighborhood of Waverley Place, especially,
on the evening of the 16th of December, did this merry
music "wake the silent air" to respond to the quick beatings of
the gay young hearts anticipating the f&ecirc;te of f&ecirc;tes, the most
brilliant party of the season, which was that evening to be
given at the house of the ruler of fashion&mdash;the elegant Mrs.
Bruton.</p>

<p>Instead of introducing our readers to the gay assemblage of
this lady's guests, we will take them to the dressing-room of the
fairest among them, the beautiful, the gay, the brilliant Caroline
Danby. As the door of this inner temple of beauty opens at
the touch of our magic wand, its inmate is seen standing before
a mirror, and her eye beams, and her lip is smiling with anticipated
triumph. Does there seem vanity in the gaze she fastens
there? Look on that form of graceful symmetry, on those
large black eyes with their jetty fringes, on the rich coloring of
her rounded cheeks, and the dewy freshness of her red lip, and
you will forget to censure. But see, the mirror reflects another
form&mdash;a form so slender that it seems scarcely to have attained
the full proportions of womanhood, and a face whose soft gray
eyes and fair complexion, and hair of the palest gold, present a
singular contrast to the dark yet glowing beauty beside her.
This is Mary Grayson, the orphan cousin of Caroline Danby,
who has grown up in her father's house. She has glided in
with her usual gentle movement, and light, noiseless step, and
Caroline first perceives her in the glass.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_50' id='Page_50' title='50'>&nbsp;</a>"Ah, Mary!" she exclaims, "I sent for you to put this
diamond spray in my hair; you arrange it with so much more
taste than any one else."</p>

<p>Mary smilingly receives the expensive ornament, and fastens
it amidst the dark, glossy tresses. At this moment the doorbell
gives forth a hasty peal, and going to the head of the
stairs, Mary remains listening till the door is opened, and then
comes back to say, "Mrs. Oswald, Caroline, and Philip."</p>

<p>"Pray, go down and entertain them till I come, Mary"&mdash;and
seemingly nothing loth, Mary complies with the request.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room to which Mary Grayson directed her
steps stood a stately looking lady, who advanced to meet her
as she entered, and kissing her affectionately, asked, "Are
you not going with us this evening?"</p>

<p>"No; my sore throat has increased, and the Doctor is
positive; there is no appeal from him, you know; I am very
sorry, for I wished to see some of Philip's foreign graces," she
said playfully, as she turned to give her hand to a gentleman
who had entered while she was speaking. He received it with
the frank kindness of a brother, but before he could reply the
door of the drawing-room opened, and Caroline Danby appeared
within it. Philip Oswald sprang forward to greet her,
and from that moment seemed forgetful that there was any
other thing in life deserving his attention, save her radiant
beauty. Perhaps there was some little regard to the effect of
his first glance at that beauty, in her presenting herself in
the drawing-room with her cloak and hood upon her arm, the
diamond sparkling in her uncovered tresses, and the soft, rich
folds of her satin dress and its flowing lace draperies, shading
without concealing the graceful outline of her form. The gentleman
who gazed so admiringly upon her, who wrapped her
cloak around her with such tender care, and even insisted,
kneeling gracefully before her, on fastening himself the warm,<a class='page' name ='Page_51' id='Page_51' title='51'>&nbsp;</a>
furred overshoes upon her slender foot, seemed a fit attendant
at the shrine of beauty. Philip Oswald had been only a few
weeks at home, after an absence of four years spent in European
travel. The quality in his appearance and manners, which
first impressed the observer, was refinement&mdash;perfect elegance,
without the least touch of coxcombry. It had been said of him,
that he had brought home the taste in dress of a Parisian, the
imaginativeness of a German, and the voice and passion for
music of an Italian. Few were admitted to such intimacy with
him as to look into the deeper qualities of the mind&mdash;but those
who were, saw there the sturdy honesty of John Bull, and the
courageous heart and independent spirit of his own America.
Some of those who knew him best, regretted that the possession
of a fortune, which placed him among the wealthiest in
America, would most probably consign him to a life of indolence,
in which his highest qualities would languish for want
of exercise.</p>

<p>By nine o'clock Caroline Danby's preparations were completed,
and leaning on one of Philip Oswald's arms, while the
other was given to his mother, she was led out, and placed in
the most splendid sleigh in New York, and wrapped in the
most costly furs. Philip followed, the weary coachman touched
his spirited horses with the whip, the sleigh-bells rang merrily
out, and Mary Grayson was left in solitude.</p>

<p>The last stroke of three had ceased to vibrate on the air when
Caroline Danby again stood beside her cousin. Mary was
sleeping, and a painter might have hesitated whether to give
the palm of beauty to the soft, fair face, which looked so angel-like
in its placid sleep, or to that which bent above her in undimmed
brilliancy.</p>

<p>"Is it you, Caroline? What time is it?" asked Mary, as
she aroused at her cousin's call.</p>

<p>"Three o'clock; but wake up, Mary; I have something to
tell you, which must not be heard by sleepy ears."</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_52' id='Page_52' title='52'>&nbsp;</a>"How fresh you look!" exclaimed Mary, sitting up in bed
and looking at her cousin admiringly. "Who would believe
you had been dancing all night!"</p>

<p>"I have not been dancing all night, nor half the night."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;what have you been doing then?"</p>

<p>"Listening to Philip Oswald. Oh Mary! I am certainly
the most fortunate woman in the world. He is mine at last&mdash;he,
the most elegant, the most brilliant man in New-York, and
with such a splendid fortune. I was so happy, so excited, that
I could not sleep, and therefore I awoke you to talk."</p>

<p>"I am glad you did, for I am almost as much pleased as
you can be&mdash;such joy is better than sleep;&mdash;but all the bells in
the city seem to be ringing&mdash;did you see any thing of the fire?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes! the whole sky at the southeast is glowing from
the flames&mdash;the largest fire, they say, that has ever been known
in the city&mdash;but it is far enough from us&mdash;down in Wall-street&mdash;and
who can think of fires with such joy before them? Only
think, Mary, with Philip's fortune and Philip's taste, what an
establishment I shall have."</p>

<p>"And what a mother in dear, good Mrs. Oswald!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but I hope she will not wish to live with us&mdash;mother-in-laws,
you know, always want to manage every thing
in their sons' houses."</p>

<p>Thus the cousins sat talking till the fire-bells ceased their
monotonous and ominous clang, and the late dawn of a winter
morning reddened the eastern sky. It was half-past nine o'clock
when they met again at their breakfast; yet late as it was, Mr.
Danby, usually a very early riser, was not quite ready for it.
He had spent most of the night at the scene of the fire, and had
with great difficulty and labor saved his valuable stock of
French goods from the destroyer. When he joined his
daughter and niece, his mind was still under the influence of
last night's excitement, and he could talk of nothing but the fire.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_53' id='Page_53' title='53'>&nbsp;</a>"Rather expensive fireworks, I am afraid," said Caroline
flippantly, as her father described the lurid grandeur of the
scene.</p>

<p>"Do not speak lightly, my daughter, of that which must
reduce many from affluence to beggary. Millions of property
were lost last night. The 16th of December, 1835, will long
be remembered in the annals of New-York, I fear."</p>

<p>"It will long be remembered in my annals," whispered
Caroline to her cousin, with a bright smile, despite her father's
chiding.</p>

<p>"Not at home to any but Mr. Philip Oswald," had been
Caroline Danby's order to the servant this morning; and thus
when she was told, at twelve o'clock, that that gentleman
awaited her in the drawing-room, she had heard nothing more
of the fire than her father and the morning paper had communicated.
As she entered, Philip arose to greet her, but though
he strove to smile as his eyes met hers, the effort was vain; and
throwing himself back on the sofa, he covered his face with his
hand, as though to hide his pallor and the convulsive quivering
of his lips from her whom he was reluctant to grieve. Emboldened
by her fears, Caroline advanced, and laying her hand
on his, exclaimed, "What is the matter?&mdash;Are you ill?&mdash;your
mother?&mdash;pray do not keep me in suspense, but tell me what
has happened."</p>

<p>He seemed to have mastered his emotion, from whatever
cause it had proceeded; for removing his hand, he looked
earnestly upon her, and drawing her to a seat beside him, said
in firm, though sad tones, "That has happened, Caroline,
which would not move me thus, but for your dear sake&mdash;I
asked you last night to share my fortune&mdash;to-day I have none
to offer you."</p>

<p>"Gracious heaven!" exclaimed Caroline, turning as pale as
he, "what do you mean?"</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_54' id='Page_54' title='54'>&nbsp;</a>"That in the fire last night, or the failures which the most
sanguine assure me it must produce, my whole fortune is involved.
If I can recover from the wreck what will secure to
my poor mother the continuance of her accustomed comforts, it
will be beyond my hopes; for me&mdash;the luxuries, the comforts,
the very necessaries of life must be the produce of my own exertion.
I do not ask you to share my poverty, Caroline; I
cannot be so selfish; had I not spoken of my love last night,
you should never have heard it&mdash;though it had been like a
burning fire, I would have shut it up within my heart&mdash;but it
is too late for this; you have heard it, and I have heard&mdash;the
remembrance brings with it a wild delirious joy, even in this
hour of darkness "&mdash;and the pale face of Philip Oswald flushed,
and his dimmed eye beamed brightly again as he spoke:
"I have heard your sweet confession of reciprocal regard.
Months, perhaps years may pass before I attain the goal at
which I last night thought myself to have already arrived&mdash;before
I can dare to call you mine&mdash;but in our land, manly
determination and perseverance ever command success, and I
fear not to promise you, dearest, one day a happy home&mdash;though
not a splendid one&mdash;if you will promise me to share it.
Look on me, Caroline&mdash;give me one smile to light me on my
way&mdash;with such a hope before me, I cannot say my <i>dreary</i>
way."</p>

<p>He ceased, yet Caroline neither looked upon him, nor spoke.
Her cheek had grown pale at his words, and she sat down with
downcast eyes, cold, still, statue-like at his side. Yet did not
Philip Oswald doubt her love. Had not her eye kindled and
her cheek flushed at his whispered vows&mdash;had not her hand
rested lovingly in his, and her lip been yielded to the first kiss
of love&mdash;how, then, could he dare to doubt her? She was
grieved for his sake&mdash;he had been selfishly abrupt in his first
communication of his sorrow, and now he&mdash;the stronger&mdash;must<a class='page' name ='Page_55' id='Page_55' title='55'>&nbsp;</a>
struggle to bear and to speak cheerfully for her sake. And
with this feeling he had been able to conclude far more cheerfully
than he commenced. As she still continued silent, he
bent forward, and would have pressed his lip to her cheek, saying,
"Not one word for me, dear one,"&mdash;but, drawing hastily
back, Caroline said with great effort,</p>

<p>"I think, Mr. Oswald&mdash;it seems to me that&mdash;that&mdash;an engagement
must be a heavy burden to one who has to make
his own way in life&mdash;I&mdash;I should be sorry to be a disadvantage
to you."</p>

<p>It was a crushing blow, and for an instant he sat stunned
into almost death-like stillness by it:&mdash;but he rallied;&mdash;he would
leave no loop on which hope or fancy might hereafter hang a
doubt. "Caroline," he said, in a voice whose change spoke the
intensity of his feelings, "do not speak of disadvantage to me&mdash;your
love was the one star left in my sky&mdash;but that matters not&mdash;what
I would know is, whether you desire that the record
of last evening should be blotted from the history of our lives?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think it had better be&mdash;I am sure I wish you well,
Mr. Oswald."</p>

<p>It was well for her, perhaps, that she did not venture to
meet his eye&mdash;that look of withering scorn could hardly ever
have vanished from her memory&mdash;it was enough to hear his
bitter laugh, and the accents in which he said, "Thank you,
Miss Danby&mdash;your wishes are fully reciprocated&mdash;may you
never know a love less prudent than your own."</p>

<p>The door closed on him, and she was alone&mdash;left to the
companionship of her own heart&mdash;evil companionship in such
an hour! She hastened to relate all that had passed to Mary,
but Mary had no assurances for her&mdash;she had only sympathy
for Philip&mdash;"dear Philip"&mdash;as she called him over and over
again. "I think it would better become one so young as you
are, to say, Mr. Oswald, Mary," said Caroline, pettishly.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_56' id='Page_56' title='56'>&nbsp;</a>"I have called him Philip from my childhood, Caroline&mdash;I
shall not begin to say Mr. Oswald <i>now</i>." Mary did not mean a
reproach, but to Caroline's accusing conscience it sounded like
one, and she turned away indignantly. She soon, however,
sought her cousin again with a note in her hand.</p>

<p>"I have been writing to Mrs. Oswald, Mary," she said;
"you are perhaps too young, and Mr. Oswald too much absorbed
in his own disappointment, to estimate the propriety of
my conduct; but she will, I am sure, agree with me, that one
expensively reared as I have been, accustomed to every luxury,
and perfectly ignorant of economy, would make the worst possible
wife to a poor man; and she has so much influence over
Mr. Oswald, that, should she accord with me in opinion on this
point, she can easily convince him of its justice. Will you take
my note to her? I do not like to send it by a servant&mdash;it
might fall into Philip's hands."</p>

<p>Nothing could have pleased Mary more than this commission,
for her affectionate heart was longing to offer its sympathy
to her friends. Mrs. Oswald assumed perhaps a little more
than her usual stateliness when she heard her announced, but
it vanished instantly before Mary's tearful eye, as she kissed the
hand that was extended to her. Mrs. Oswald folded her arms
around her, and Mary sank sobbing upon the bosom of her
whom she had come to console. And Mrs. Oswald was consoled
by such true and tender sympathy. It was long before
Mary could prevail on herself to disturb the flow of gentler affections
by delivering Caroline's note. Mrs. Oswald received it
with an almost contemptuous smile, which remained unchanged
while she read. It was a labored effort to make her conduct
seem a generous determination not to obstruct Philip's course
in life, by binding him to a companion so unsuitable to his
present prospects as herself. In reply, Mrs. Oswald assured
Caroline Danby of her perfect agreement with her in the con<a class='page' name ='Page_57' id='Page_57' title='57'>&nbsp;</a>viction
that she would make a very unsuitable wife for Philip
Oswald. "This," she added, "was always my opinion, though
I was unwilling to oppose my son's wishes. I thank you for
having convinced him I was right in the only point on which
we ever differed."</p>

<p>It cannot be supposed that this note was very pleasing to
Caroline Danby; but, whatever were her dissatisfaction, she
did not complain, and probably soon lost all remembrance of
her chagrin in the gayeties which a few men of fortune still remained,
amidst the almost universal ruin, to promote and to
partake.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Philip Oswald was experiencing that restlessness,
that burning desire to free himself from all his present
associations, to begin, as it were, a new life, which the first
pressure of sorrow so often arouses in the ardent spirit. Had
not his will been "bound down by the iron chain of necessity,"
he would probably have returned to Europe, and wasted his energies
amidst aimless wanderings. As it was, he chose among
those modes of life demanded by his new circumstances, that
which would take him farthest from New-York, and place him
in a condition the most foreign to all his past experience, and
demanding the most active and most incessant exertion. Out
of that which the fire, the failure of Insurance Companies and
of private individuals, had left him remained, after the purchase
of a liberal annuity for his mother, a few thousands to be devoted
either to merchandise, to his support while pursuing the
studies necessary for the acquirement of a profession, or to any
mode of gaining a living, which he might prefer to these. The
very hour which ascertained this fact, saw his resolution taken
and his course marked out.</p>

<p>"I must have new scenery for this new act in the drama of
my life," he said to his mother. "I must away&mdash;away from
all the artificialities and trivialities of my present world, to the<a class='page' name ='Page_58' id='Page_58' title='58'>&nbsp;</a>
rich prairies, the wide streams, the boundless expanse of the
West. I go to make a new home for you dear mother&mdash;you
shall be the queen of my kingdom."</p>

<p>This was not the choice that would have pleased an ambitious,
or an over-fond mother. The former would have preferred
a profession, as conferring higher social distinction; the
latter would have shrunk from seeing one nursed in the lap of
luxury go forth to encounter the hardships of a pioneer. But
Mrs. Oswald possessed an intelligence which recognized in that
life of bold adventure, and physical endurance, and persevering
labor, that awaited her son in the prosecution of his plans, the
best school for the development of that decision and force of
character which she had desired as the crowning seal to Philip's
intellectual endowments, warm affections, and just principles;
and, holding his excellence as the better part of her own
happiness, she sanctioned his designs, and did all in her power
to promote their execution. He waited, therefore, only to see
her leave the house whose rent now exceeded her whole annual
income, for pleasant rooms in a boarding-house, agreeably
situated, before he set out from New-York.</p>

<p>It is not our intention minutely to trace his course, to describe
the "local habitation" which he acquired, or detail the
difficulties which arose in his progress, the strength with which
he combated, or the means by which he overcame them. For
his course, suffice it that it was westward; for his habitation,
that it was on the slope of a hill crowned with the gigantic
trees of that fertile soil, and beside a lake, "a sheet of silver"
well fitted to be&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A mirror and a bath for beauty's youngest daughters;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and that the house, which he at length succeeded in raising
and furnishing there, united somewhat the refinement of his
past life to the simplicity of his present; for his difficulties, we<a class='page' name ='Page_59' id='Page_59' title='59'>&nbsp;</a>
can only say, he met them and conquered them, and gained
from each encounter knowledge and power. For two years,
letters were the only medium of intercourse between his mother
and himself, but those letters were a history&mdash;a history not
only of his stirring, outer life, but of that inner life which yet
more deeply interested her. Feeling proud herself of the daring
spirit, the iron will, the ready invention which these letters
displayed, yet prouder of the affectionate heart, the true and
generous nature, it is not wonderful that Mrs. Oswald should
have often read them, or at least parts of them, to her constant
friend and very frequent visitor, Mary Grayson. Nor is it more
strange that Mary, thus made to recognize in the most interesting
man she had yet known, far more lofty claims to her admiration,
should have enshrined him in her young and pure imagination
as some "bright, particular star."</p>

<p>Two years in the future! How almost interminable seems
the prospect to our hopes or our affections!&mdash;but let Time
turn his perspective glass&mdash;let us look at it in the past, and
how it shrinks and becomes as a day in the history of our
lives! So was it with Philip Oswald's two years of absence,
when he found himself, in the earliest dawn of the spring of
1838, once more in New-York. Yet that time had not passed
without leaving traces of its passage&mdash;traces in the changes
affecting those around him&mdash;yet deeper traces in himself.
He arrived in the afternoon of an earlier day than that on
which he had been expected. In the evening Mrs. Oswald
persuaded him to assume, for the gratification of her curiosity,
the picturesque costume worn by him in his western home.
He had just re-entered her room, and she was yet engaged in
animated observation of the hunting-shirt, strapped around the
waist with a belt of buckskin, the open collar, and loosely
knotted cravat, which, as the mother's heart whispered, so well
became that tall and manly form, when there was a slight tap<a class='page' name ='Page_60' id='Page_60' title='60'>&nbsp;</a>
at the door, and before she could speak, it opened, and Mary
Grayson stood within it. She gazed in silence for a moment
on the striking figure before her, and her mind rapidly
scanned the changes which time and new modes of life had
made in the Philip Oswald of her memory. As she did so,
she acknowledged that the embrowned face and hands, the
broader and more vigorous proportions, and even the easy
freedom of his dress, were more in harmony with the bold and
independent aspect which his character had assumed, than the
delicacy and elegance by which he had formerly been distinguished.
His outer man was now the true index of a noble,
free, and energetic spirit&mdash;a spirit which, having conquered
itself, was victor over all&mdash;and as such, it attracted from Mary
a deeper and more reverent admiration, than she had felt for
him when adorned with all the trappings of wealth and luxurious
refinement. The very depth of this sentiment destroyed
the ease of her manner towards him, and as Philip Oswald
took the hand formerly so freely offered him, and heard from
her lips the respectful Mr. Oswald, instead of the frank, sisterly
Philip, he said to himself&mdash;"She looks down upon the backwoodsman,
and would have him know his place." So much
for man's boasted penetration!</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the barrier of reserve thus erected between
them, Philip Oswald could not but admire the rare loveliness
into which Mary Grayson's girlish prettiness had expanded,
and again, and yet again, while she was speaking to
his mother, and could not therefore perceive him, he turned
to gaze on her, fascinated not by the finely turned form or
beautiful features, but by the countenance beaming with gentle
and refined intelligence. Here was none of the brilliancy
which had dazzled his senses in Caroline Danby, but an
expression of mind and heart far more captivating to him
who had entered into the inner mysteries of life.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_61' id='Page_61' title='61'>&nbsp;</a>A fortnight was the limit of Philip Oswald's stay in the
city. He had come not for his mother, but for the house in
which she was to live, and he carried it back with him. We
do not mean that his house, with all its conveniences of
kitchen and pantry, its elegances of parlor and drawing-room,
and its decorations of pillar and cornice fitly joined together,
travelled off with him to the far West. We do not despair of
seeing such a feat performed some day, but we believe it has
not yet been done, and Philip Oswald, at least, did not attempt
it; he took with him, however, all those useful and ornamental
contrivances in their several parts, accompanied by
workmen skilled in putting the whole together. Again in his
western home, for another year, his head and his hands were
fully occupied with building and planting. For the first two
years of his forest life, he had thought only of the substantial
produce of the field&mdash;the rye, the barley, the Indian corn,
which were to be exchanged for the "omnipotent dollar"&mdash;but
woman was coming, and beauty and grace must be the
herald of her steps. For his mother, he planted fruits and
flowers, opened views of the lake, made a gravelled walk to
its shore bordered with flowering shrubs, and wreathed the
woodbine, the honeysuckle, and the multiflora rose around
the columns of his piazza. For his mother this was done, and
yet, when the labors of the day were over, and he looked
forth upon them in the cool, still evening hour, it was not his
mother's face, but one younger and fairer which peered out
upon him from the vine-leaves, or with tender smiles wooed
him to the lake. Young, fair, and tender as it was, its wooings
generally sent him in an opposite direction, with a sneer
at his own folly, to stifle his fancies with a book, or to mark
out the plan of the morrow's operations.</p>

<p>More than a year had passed away and Philip Oswald was
again in New-York, just as spring was gliding into the ardent<a class='page' name ='Page_62' id='Page_62' title='62'>&nbsp;</a>
embraces of summer. This time he had come for his mother,
and with all the force of his resolute will, he shut his ears to
the flattering suggestions of fancy, that a dearer pleasure
than even that mother's presence might be won. He had
looked steadily upon his lot in life, and he accepted it, and determined
to make the best of it and to be happy in it; yet
he felt that it was after all a rugged lot. Without considering
all women as mercenary as Caroline Danby, which his
knowledge of his mother forbade him to do, even in his most
woman-scorning mood, he yet doubted whether any of those
who had been reared amidst the refinements of cultivated life,
could be won to leave them all for love in the western wilds;
and as the unrefined could have no charms for him, he deliberately
embraced <i>bachelordom</i> as a part of his portion, and, not
without a sigh, yielded himself to the conviction that all the
wealth of woman's love within his power to attain, was locked
within a mother's heart.</p>

<p>A fortnight was again the allotted time of Philip Oswald's
stay; but when that had expired, he was persuaded to delay
his departure for yet another week. He had been drawn, by accompanying
his mother in her farewell visits, once more within
the vortex of society, and his manly independence and energy,
his knowledge of what was to his companions a new world,
and his spirit-stirring descriptions of its varied beauty and inexhaustible
fertility, made him more the fashion than he had
ever been. He had often met Caroline Danby&mdash;now Mrs.
Randall&mdash;and Mary more than once delicately turned her eyes
away from her cousin's face, lest she should read there somewhat
of chagrin as Mr. Randall, with his meaningless face and
dapper-looking form&mdash;insignificant in all save the reputation
of being the wealthiest banker in Wall-street, and possessing
the most elegant house and furniture, the best appointed<a class='page' name ='Page_63' id='Page_63' title='63'>&nbsp;</a>
equipage, and the handsomest wife in the city&mdash;stood beside
Philip Oswald with</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">"&mdash;&mdash;a form indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where every god did seem to set his seal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give the world assurance of a man,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and a face radiant with intelligence, while circled by an
attentive auditory of that which was noblest and best in their
world, his eloquent enthusiasm made them hear the rushing
waters, see the boundless prairies, and feel for a time all the
wild freedom of the untamed West. Such enthusiasm was
gladly welcomed as a breeze in the still air, a ruffle in the
stagnant waters of fashionable life.</p>

<p>Within two or three days of their intended departure, Mrs.
Oswald proposed to Philip that they should visit a friend residing
near Fort Lee, and invited Mary to accompany them.
Among the acquaintances whom they found on board was an
invalid lady, who could not bear the fresh air upon deck; and
Mary, pitying her loneliness and seclusion, remained for awhile
conversing with her in the cabin. Mrs. Oswald and Philip
were on deck, and near them was a young and giddy girl, to
whose care a mother had intrusted a bold, active, joyous infant,
seemingly about eight months old.</p>

<p>"That is a dangerous position for so lively a child," said
Philip Oswald to the young nurse, as he saw her place him on
the side of the boat; "he may spring from your arms overboard."</p>

<p>With that foolish tempting of the danger pointed out by
another, which we sometimes see even in women, the girl
removed her arms from around the child, sustaining only a
slight hold of its frock. At this moment the flag of the boat
floated within view of the little fellow, and he sprang towards
it. A splash in the water told the rest&mdash;but even before that<a class='page' name ='Page_64' id='Page_64' title='64'>&nbsp;</a>
was heard, Philip Oswald had dashed off his boots and coat,
and the poor child had scarcely touched the waves when he
was beside it, and held it encircled in his arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary! Mr. Oswald! Mr. Oswald!" cried one of
Mary's young acquaintances, rushing into the cabin with a face
blanched with terror.</p>

<p>"What of him?" questioned Mary, starting eagerly forward.</p>

<p>"He is in the water. Oh, Mary! he will be drowned."</p>

<p>Mary did not utter a sound, yet she felt in that moment,
for the first time, how important to her was Philip Oswald's
life. Tottering towards the door, she leaned against it for a
moment while all around grew dark, and strange sounds were
buzzing in her ears. The next instant she sank into a chair and
lost her terrors in unconsciousness. The same young lady who
had played the alarmist to her, as she saw the paleness of death
settle on Mary's face and her eyes close, ran again upon the
deck, exclaiming, "Mary Grayson is fainting,&mdash;pray come to
Mary Grayson."</p>

<p>Philip Oswald was already on deck, dripping indeed, but
unharmed and looking nobler than ever, as he held the
recovered child in his arms. As that cry, "Mary Grayson is
fainting," reached his ears, he threw the infant to a bystander,
and hastened to the cabin followed by Mrs. Oswald.</p>

<p>"What has caused this?" cried Mrs. Oswald, as she saw
Mary still insensible, supported on the bosom of her invalid friend.</p>

<p>"Miss Ladson's precipitation," said the invalid, looking not
very pleasantly on that young lady; "she told her Mr. Oswald
was drowning."</p>

<p>"Well, I am sure I thought he was drowning."</p>

<p>"If he had been, it would have been a pity to give such
information so abruptly," said Mrs. Oswald, as she took off
Mary's bonnet, and loosened the scarf which was tied around
her neck.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_65' id='Page_65' title='65'>&nbsp;</a>"I am sure," exclaimed Miss Ladson, anxious only to secure
herself from blame,&mdash;"I am sure I did not suppose Mary would
faint; for when her uncle's horse threw him, and every body
thought he was killed, instead of fainting she ran out in the
street, and did for him more than any body else could do. I
am sure I could not think she would care more for Mr. Oswald's
danger than for her own uncle's."</p>

<p>No one replied to this insinuation; but that Philip Oswald
heard it, might have been surmised from the sudden flush that
rose to his temples, and from his closer clasp of the unconscious
form, which at his mother's desire he was bearing to a settee.
Whether it were the water which oozed from his saturated
garments over her face and neck, or some subtle magnetic fluid
conveyed in that tender clasp, that aroused her, we cannot tell;
but a faint tinge of color revisited her cheeks and lips, and as
Philip laid her tenderly down, while his arms were still around
her, and his face was bending over her, she opened her eyes.
What there was in that first look which called such a sudden
flash of joy into Philip Oswald's eyes, we know not; nor what
were the whispered words which, as he bowed his head yet
lower, sent a crimson glow into Mary's pale cheeks. This
however we do know, that Mrs. Oswald and her son delayed
their journey for yet another week; and that the day before
their departure Philip Oswald stood with Mary Grayson at his
side before God's holy altar, and there, in the presence of his
mother, Mr. Danby, Mr. and Mrs. Randall, and a few friends,
they took those vows which made them one for ever.</p>

<p>Does some starched prude, or some lady interested in the
bride's <i>trousseau</i>, exclaim against such unseemly haste? We
have but one excuse for them. They were so unfashionable as
to prefer the gratification of a true affection to the ceremonies
so dear to vanity, and to think more of the earnest claims of
life than of its gilded pomps.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_66' id='Page_66' title='66'>&nbsp;</a>Mr. Danby had been unable to pay down the bride's small
dower of 8000 dollars; and when he called on his son-in-law,
Mr. Randall, to assist him, he could only offer to indorse his
note to Mr. Oswald for the amount, acknowledging that it would
be perilous at that time to abstract even half that amount from
his business. It probably would have been perilous indeed, as
in little more than a month after he failed for an enormous
amount; but fear not, reader, for the gentle Caroline: she still
retained her elegant house and furniture, her handsome equipage
and splendid jewels. These were only a small part of what
the indignant creditors found had been made over to her by
her grateful husband.</p>

<p>Six years have passed away since the occurrence of the
events we have been recording. Caroline Randall, weary of
the sameness of splendor in her home, has been abroad for
two years, travelling with a party of friends. It is said&mdash;convenient
phrase that&mdash;that her husband had declared she must
and shall return, and that to enforce his will he has resolved to
send her no more remittances, to honor no more of her drafts,
as she has already almost beggared him by her extravagance
abroad. Verily, she has her reward!</p>

<p>One farewell glance at our favorite, Mary Grayson, and we
have done.</p>

<p>Beside a lovely lake, over whose margin light graceful
shrubs are bending, and on whose transparent waters lie the
dense forest shadows, though here and there the golden rays of
the declining sun flash through the tangled boughs upon its
dancing waves, a noble-looking boy of four years old is sailing
his mimic fleet, while a lovely girl, two years younger, toddles
about, picking "pitty flowers," and bringing them to "papa,
mamma, or grandmamma," as her capricious fancy prompts.
Near by, papa, mamma, grandmamma, and one pleased and
honored guest, are grouped beneath the bending boughs of a<a class='page' name ='Page_67' id='Page_67' title='67'>&nbsp;</a>
magnificent black walnut, and around a table on which strawberries
and cream, butter sweet as the breath of the cows that
yielded it, biscuits light and white, and bread as good as
Humbert himself could make, are served in a style of elegant
simplicity, while the silver urn in which the water hisses, and
the small china cups into which the fragrant tea is poured, if
they are somewhat antique in fashion, are none the less
beautiful or the less valued by those who still prize the
slightest object associated with the affections beyond the gratification
of the vanity.</p>

<p>The evening meal is over. The shadows grow darker on
the lake. Agreeable conversation has given place to silent
enjoyment, which Mrs. Oswald interrupts to say, "Philip, this
is the hour for music; let us have some before Mary leaves us
with the children."</p>

<p>Full, deep-toned was the manly voice that swelled upon
that evening air, and soft and clear its sweet accompaniment,
while the words, full of adoring gratitude and love, seemed
incense due to the heaven which had so blessed them.</p>

<p>The last sweet notes had died away, and Mary, calling the
children, leads them to their quiet repose, after they have bestowed
their good-night kisses. Philip Oswald follows her
with his eyes, as, with a child on each hand, she advances with
gentle grace upon the easy slope, to the house on its summit.
She enters the piazza, and is screened from his view by its lattice-work
of vines, but he knows that soon his children will be
lisping their evening prayer at her knee, and the thought calls
a tender expression to his eyes as he turns them away from his
"sweet home."</p>

<p>This morning, as I sat in the library writing a letter, Annie
came in and seated herself at a table on the opposite side of
the room. Her unusual stillness caused me to look up after
some minutes, and I found that Mr. Arlington's portfolio having
been left upon the table, she had drawn from it one of his pencilings,
and was gazing steadfastly upon it, as I could not but
think, with something troubled in the expression of her usually
open and cheerful face. While I was still observing her, the
door behind her opened, and Mr. Arlington himself entered. A
blush arose to Annie's cheeks as she saw him; a blush which
had its origin, I thought, in some deeper feeling than a mere
girlish shame at being found so engrossed by one of his productions.</p>

<p>"What have you there?" he asked, as seating himself
beside her, he took the paper from what seemed to me her somewhat
reluctant hand. No sooner had he looked on it, than his
own bright face became shadowed, as hers had been, and yet
he smiled, too, as he said, "That portfolio is really an <i>omnium
gatherum</i>. I had no idea this had found its way there. When
I first read Mrs. Hemans' poem of 'The Bird's Release,' it reminded
me of this scene of my boyhood, though if I have never
spoken to you of my darling Grace, you will not be able to understand
why."</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_69' id='Page_69' title='69'>&nbsp;</a>"You never have," said Annie, answering his looks rather
than his words, while a slight increase of color was again perceptible in her fair cheek.</p>

<p>"She was my sister, my only sister; we were but two, the
petted darlings of a widowed mother. I told you, that few could
sympathize as I could with K&ouml;rner's memory of Mother-love.
I was but six years old, and just such a chubby, broad-shouldered
little varlet, I fancy, as I have sketched here, when Grace,
who was two years older, and the loveliest, merriest little creature
in the world, died. My mother was already beginning to
feel the influence of that disease, which, two years later, terminated
her life, and, I have no doubt, the death of Grace, who
was her idol, increased the rapidity of its progress."</p>

<p>There was silence for some minutes, and then Annie said
softly, "But what of the bird?"</p>

<p>"It was a thrush which had been given to Grace some time
before her death, and which she was trying to tame for me.
My mother could not bear to see it after her death, and with
some difficulty persuaded me to give it its liberty. You will
now see why I should have dedicated this sketch to Grace,
and why these lines should have brought the scene to my
mind, and caused me indeed to make this drawing of it."</p>

<p>"Will you read the lines for me?" asked Annie, "I had
not finished them when you took the paper from me."</p>

<p>To tell you a secret, reader, I do not believe she had seen
any thing on the paper except the few words in German text
written at its head, "To my darling Grace."</p>

<p>Mr. Arlington read in a tone of feeling and interest,&mdash;</p>

<p>I was doubtful whether either Mr. Arlington or Annie were
aware of my presence, and was just debating with myself whether
I should make them aware of it by addressing them, or
quietly steal away, when Col. Donaldson decided the point by
entering the library and speaking to me. He came to ask that
I would come to the parlor and see a boy who had just been
sent from one of our charitable institutions, to which he had
applied for a lad to act as a helper to his old waiter, John, who
was now old enough to require some indulgence, and had always
been trustworthy enough to deserve some. The boy
looked intelligent and honest&mdash;he was neat in his person and
active in his movements.</p>

<p>"He is an orphan," said Col. Donaldson, "and the managers
of the institution have offered to bind him to me for seven
years, or till he is of age. What do you think of it!"</p>

<p>"If the boy himself be willing, I should be glad to know he
was so well provided for," I replied; "though in general, no
abolitionist can be more vehemently opposed to negro slavery
than I am to this apprenticeship business. What is it but a
slavery of the worst description? The master is endowed with
irresponsible power, without the interest in the well-being of
his slave, which the planter, the actual owner of slaves, ordinarily
feels."</p>

<p>"You speak strongly," said Col. Donaldson.</p>

<p>"I feel strongly on this subject," I answered. "I knew<a class='page' name ='Page_72' id='Page_72' title='72'>&nbsp;</a>
one instance of the effects of this system which I have often
thought of publishing to the world, as speaking more powerfully
against it than a thousand addresses could do."</p>

<p>"Tell it to us, Aunt Nancy," said Robert Dudley.</p>

<p>"It is too long to tell now," said I, as the dinner-bell
sounded.</p>

<p>"Then let us have it this evening," urged Col. Donaldson&mdash;"for
it is a subject in which I am much interested."</p>

<p>Accordingly, in the evening, I gave them the "o'er true
tale" of</p>


<h3><a name="THE_YOUNG_MISANTHROPE" id="THE_YOUNG_MISANTHROPE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE YOUNG MISANTHROPE.</a></h3>

<p>"In the blue summer ocean, far off and alone," lies a little
island, known to mariners in the Pacific only for the fine
water with which it supplies them, and for the bold shore which
makes it possible for ships of considerable tonnage to lie in
quiet near the land. Discovered at first by accident, it has
been long, for these reasons, visited both by English and American
whalers. A few years since, and no trace of man's presence
could be found there beyond the belt of rocks, amidst
which arose the springs that were the chief, and indeed only
attraction the island presented to the rough, hardy men by
whom it had been visited. But within that stony girdle lay a
landscape soft and lovely as any that arose within the tropical
seas. There the plantain waved its leafy crown, the orange
shed its rich perfume, and bore its golden fruit aloft upon the
desert air, and the light, feathery foliage of the tamarind moved
gracefully to the touch of the dallying breeze. All was green,
and soft, and fair, for there no winter chills the life of nature,
but,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The bee banquets on through a whole year of flowers."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was a scene which might have seemed created for the<a class='page' name ='Page_73' id='Page_73' title='73'>&nbsp;</a>
abode of some being too bright and good for the common
earth of common men, or for some Hinda and Hafed, who,
driven from a world all too harsh and evil for their nobler natures,
might have found in it a refuge,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where the bright eyes of angels only<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should come around them to behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A paradise so pure and lonely."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Alas for the dream of the poet! This beautiful island became
the refuge, not of pure and loving hearts, but of one from
whose nature cruel tyranny seemed to have blotted out every
feeling and every faculty save hatred and fear; and he who
first introduced into its yet untainted solitudes the bitter sorrows
and dark passions of humanity, was a child, who, but ten years
before, had lain in all the loveliness of sinless infancy upon a
mother's bosom. Of that mother's history he knew nothing&mdash;whether
her sin or only her sorrows had thrown him fatherless
upon the world, he was ignorant&mdash;he had only a dim memory
of gentle eyes, which had looked on him as no others had ever
looked, and of a low, sweet voice, speak to him such words as
he had never heard from any other. He had been loved, and
that love had made his life of penury in an humble hovel in
England, bright and beautiful; but his mother had passed away
from earth, and with her all the light of his existence. Child
as he was, the succeeding darkness preserved long in brightness
the memory of the last look from her fast glazing eyes, the last
words from her dying lips, the last touch of her already death-cold
hand. She died, and the same reluctant charity which
consigned her to a pauper's grave, gave to her boy a dwelling
in the parish poor-house. With the tender mercies of such institutions
the author of Oliver Twist has made the world acquainted.
They were such in the present case, that the poor
little Edward Hallett welcomed as the first glad words that had<a class='page' name ='Page_74' id='Page_74' title='74'>&nbsp;</a>
fallen on his ears for two long, weary years, the news that he
was to be bound apprentice to a captain sailing from Portsmouth
in a whaling ship. He learned rather from what was
said <i>near</i> him, than <i>to</i> him, that this man wanted a cabin boy,
but would not have one who was not bound to him, or to use
the more expressive language in which it reached the ears of
his destined victim, "one with whom he could not do as he
pleased."</p>

<p>He who had come within the poor-house walls at six years
old, a glad, rosy-cheeked, chubby child, went from them at
eight, thin, and pale, and grave, with a frame broken by want
and labor, a mind clouded, and a heart repressed by unkindness.
But, sad as was the history of those years, the succeeding two
taught the poor boy to regard them as the vanished brightness
of a dream. The man&mdash;we should more justly say, the fiend&mdash;to
whom the next fourteen years of his life were by bond devoted,
was a savage by nature, and had been rendered yet more
brutal by habits of intoxication. In his drunken orgies, his favorite
pastime was to torture the unfortunate being whom the
"guardians of the poor" of an English parish had placed in his
power. It would make the heart of the reader sick, were we
to attempt a detail of the many horrible inventions by which this
modern Caligula amused his leisure hours, and made life hideous
to his victim. Nor was it only from this arch-fiend that
the poor boy suffered. Mate, cook, and sailors, soon found in
him a butt for their jokes, an object on which they might safely
vent their ill-humor, and a convenient cover for their own delinquencies.</p>

<p>He was beaten for and by them. The evil qualities which
man had himself elicited from his nature, if not implanted there&mdash;the
sullenness, and hardiness, and cunning he evinced, were
made an excuse for further injury. During his first voyage of
eighteen months, spite of all this, hope was not entirely dead in<a class='page' name ='Page_75' id='Page_75' title='75'>&nbsp;</a>
his heart. The ship was to return to England, and he determined
to run away from her, and find his way back to the
poor-house. It was a miserable refuge, but it was his only one.
He escaped&mdash;he found his way thither through many dangers&mdash;he
told his story. It was heard with incredulity, and he was
returned to his tormentors, to learn that there is even in hell "a
deeper hell."</p>

<p>Again he went on a whaling voyage. Day after day the
fathomless, the seemingly illimitable sea, the image of the Infinite
was around him&mdash;but his darkened mind saw in it only
a prison, which shut him in with his persecutors. Night after
night the stars beamed peacefully above him, luring his thoughts
upward, but he saw in them only the signals of drunken revelry
to others, and of deeper woe to himself. There was but one
wish in his heart&mdash;it had almost ceased to be a hope&mdash;to escape
from man; to live and die where he should never see his form,
never hear his voice. The ship encountered a severe storm.
She was driven from her course, her voyage lengthened, and
some of her water-casks were stove in. They made for an island,
not far distant, by the chart, to take in a fresh supply of
water. Edward Hallett heard the sailors say to each other that
this island was uninhabited, and his wish grew into a passionate
desire&mdash;a hope. For the completion of this hope, he had
but one resource&mdash;the sword and the shield of the feeble&mdash;cunning;
and well he exercised his weapon.</p>

<p>The ship lay within a quarter of a mile of the shore, and a
boat was sent to procure water&mdash;one man remaining always to
fill the empty vessels while the others returned to the ship with
those already filled. The best means of accomplishing his purpose
that occurred to the poor boy was to feign the utmost degree
of terror at the lonely and unprotected situation of this
man during the absence of his comrades. He spoke his terrors
where he knew they would be heard by the prime author of
his miseries. The result was what he had anticipated.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_76' id='Page_76' title='76'>&nbsp;</a>"Ye're afraid, are ye, of being left there by yerself! Ye'd
rather be whipped, or tied up by the thumbs, or be kept at the
mast-head all night, would ye? Then, dam'me, that's just
what I'll do to you. Here, hold on with that boat&mdash;take this
youngster with you, and you can bring back Tom, and leave
him to fill the casks for you."</p>

<p>Well did the object of his tyranny act his part. He entreated,
he adjured all around him to save him from so dreaded
a fate&mdash;in vain, of course&mdash;for his affected agonies only riveted
the determination of his tyrant. It was a new delight to see
him writhe in agony, and strive to draw back from those who
were urging him to the boat. He was forced in, borne to the
island, and left to his task. But this was not enough. He could
not escape in the broad light of day, from a spot directly under
the eyes of his tormentors, while between him and the ship a
boat was ever coming and going. Through the day he must
persist in the part he had assumed. He did not fail to continue
it, and when the day approached its close, he sent to the ship
the most urgent entreaties that he might be allowed to return
there before it was night. The sailors, rough and hard as they
generally were to him, sympathized with his agony of fear, and
asked that he might return; but his demon was now inflamed
by drink, and every word in favor of his petition insured its rejection.
He even made the unusual exertion of going up himself
in the last boat, that he might see the victim of his malice,
and feast his ears with the cries and objurgations which terror
would wring from him.</p>

<p>"If we should forget you in the morning, you can take the
next homeward bound ship that stops here, but don't tell your
friends at the poor-house too bad a tale of us," were the parting
words of this wretch.</p>

<p>Darkness and silence were around the desolate boy, but they
brought no fear with them. Man, his enemy, was not there.<a class='page' name ='Page_77' id='Page_77' title='77'>&nbsp;</a>
He saw not the beauty of the heavens, from which the stars
looked down on him in their unchanged serenity, or of the
earth, where flowers were springing at his feet, and graceful
shrubs were waving over him. He heard not the deep-toned
sea uttering its solemn music, or the breeze whispering its softer
notes in his ear. He only saw the ship, the abode of men, fading
into indistinctness, as the darkness threw its veil over it; he
only heard the voice in his heart, proclaiming ever and
again, "I am free." Before the morrow dawned, he had surmounted
the rocks at the landing place, and wandered on with
no aim, but to put as great a distance as possible between him
and the ship. Two hours' walking brought him again to the
sea, in an opposite direction to that by which he had approached
the island. Here he crawled into a hiding-place among the
rocks, and lay down to rest. The day was again declining
before he ventured forth from his covert, and cautiously approached
the distant shore, whence he might see the ship. He
reached the spring by which he had stood yester eve, when his
companions parted from him, with something like pity stirring
in the hearts of all but one among them. Fearfully he looked
around&mdash;before him&mdash;but no shadow on the earth, no sail upon
the pathless sea, told of man's presence. He was alone&mdash;alone
indeed, for the beauty of Nature aroused no emotion in his
withered heart, and he held no communion with Nature's God.
He was indeed an orphaned soul. Could he have loved, had it
been but a simple flower, he would have felt something of the
joy of life; but the very power of love seemed to have been
crushed from his heart, by years of cold neglect and harsh unkindness.</p>

<p>Weeks, months passed, without any event that might
awaken the young solitary from his torpor. By day, he roved
through the island, or lay listlessly under the shadow of a tree;
by night, he slept beneath the rocks which had first sheltered<a class='page' name ='Page_78' id='Page_78' title='78'>&nbsp;</a>
him; while the fruits, that grew and ripened without his care,
gave him food. Thus he lived a merely animal life, his strongest
sensation one of satisfaction for his relief from positive suffering,
but with nothing that could be called joy in the present,
and with no hope for the future; one to whom God had given
an immortal spirit, capable of infinite elevation in the scale of
intelligence and happiness, and whom man had pressed down
to&mdash;ay, below&mdash;the level of the brutes, which sported away
their brief existence at his side. Such tyranny as he had experienced,
is rare; but its results may well give an impressive, a
fearful lesson, to those to whom are committed the destinies of
a being unconnected with them by any of those ties which
awaken tenderness, and call forth indulgence in the sternest
minds. Let them beware, lest the "iron rule" crush out the
life of the young heart, and darken the intellect by extinguishing
the light of hope.</p>

<p>Terrible was the retribution which his crimes wrought out
for the author of our young hero's miseries. When he received
the intelligence from the men whom he had sent in the morning
to bring him from the island, that he was nowhere to be found,
he read in their countenance what his own heart was ready to
repeat to him, that he was his murderer; for neither they nor
he doubted that the terrified boy had rushed into the sea, and
been drowned in the effort to escape the horrors raised by his
wild and superstitious fancy. From that hour his persecutor
suffered tortures as great as his bitterest enemies could have desired
to inflict on him. The images which drove him with increased
eagerness to the bottle, became more vivid and terrific
under the influence of intoxication. He drank deeper and deeper,
in the vain hope to banish them, and died ere many months
had passed, shouting, in his last moments, alternate prayers and
curses to the imagined form of him whom he supposed the hope
of revenge had conjured from the ocean grave to which his
cruelties had consigned him.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_79' id='Page_79' title='79'>&nbsp;</a>Five months passed over Edward Hallett, in the dead calm
of an existence agitated by neither hope nor fear. The calm
was broken one evening by the sight of a seaman, drawing
water from the spring which had brought his former companions
to the island. As he came in sight, the man turned his head,
and stood for an instant spell-bound by the unexpected vision
of a human being on that island, whose matted locks and
tattered garments spoke the extreme of misery. There was
only one hope for the sad wild boy&mdash;it was in flight&mdash;and
turning, he ran swiftly back; but the path was strewn with
rocks, and, in his haste, he stumbled and fell. In a moment
his pursuer stood beside him, acclaiming in a coarse, but kindly
meant language:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What the devil are you runnin' away from me for,
youngster?&mdash;I'm sure I wouldn't hurt ye&mdash;but get up, and tell
us what you're doing here, and where ye've come from."</p>

<p>The speaker attempted, while addressing the boy, to raise
him from the ground, but he resisted all his efforts, and met all
his questioning with sullen silence.</p>

<p>"By the powers, I'm thinking I've caught a wild man. I
wonder if there's any more of 'em. If I can only get this one
aboard, he'll make my fortune. I'll try for it, any how, and
offer the capting to go shares with my bargain;" and he proceeded
to lift the slight form of the pauper boy in his brawny
arms, and bear him to the boat, which, during the scene, had
approached the shore. One who had had less experience of the
iron nature of man, would have endeavored, in Edward Hallett's
circumstances, to move his captor by entreaties to leave him to
his dearly prized freedom; but he had long believed, with the
poet,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There is no pulse in man's obdurate heart&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It does not feel for man;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and after the first wild struggle, which had only served to show<a class='page' name ='Page_80' id='Page_80' title='80'>&nbsp;</a>
that he was an infant in the hands of the strong seaman, he
abandoned himself to his fate, in silent despair. With closed
eyes and lips, he suffered himself, without a movement, to be
borne to the boat, and deposited in it, amidst the many uncouth
and characteristic exclamations of his captor and his companions,
who would not be convinced that it was really a child of the
human race, thus strangely found on this isolated spot. Hastily
they bore him to the ship, which the providence of God had
sent, under the guidance of a kind and noble spirit, for the
salvation of this, his not forgotten, though long tried creature.</p>

<p>Captain Durbin, of the barque Good Intent, was one who
combined, in no usual degree, the qualities of boldness and
energy with the kindest, the tenderest, and most generous
feelings. These were wrought into beautiful harmony, by the
Christian principles which had long governed his life, and from
which he had learned to be, at the same time, "diligent in
business" and "kindly affectioned"&mdash;to have no <i>fear</i> of man,
and to love his brother, whom he had seen, as the best
manifestation of devotion to God, whom he had not seen.
Perhaps he had escaped the usual effect of his rough trade, in
hardening the manners, at least, by the influence on him of his
only child, a little girl, now six years old, who was his constant
companion, even in his voyages. Little Emily Durbin had lost
her mother when she was only two years old. The circumstances
of her own childhood had wrought into the mind
of the dying Mrs. Durbin, the conviction that only a parent is
a fitting guardian for a child. To all argument on this subject
she would reply, "It seems to me that God has put so much
love into a parent's heart, only that he may bear with all a
child's waywardness, which other people can't be expected to
bear with."</p>

<p>True to her principles, she had exacted a promise from her<a class='page' name ='Page_81' id='Page_81' title='81'>&nbsp;</a>
husband, in her dying hour, that he would never part from their
Emily. The promise had been sacredly kept.</p>

<p>"I will retire from sea as soon as I have enough to buy a
place on shore, for Emily's sake; but till then, her home must
be in my cabin. She is under God's care there, as well as on
shore, and perhaps it would be better for her, should I be lost at
sea, to share my fate." Such were the remarks of Captain
Durbin, in reply to the well-meant remonstrances of his friends.</p>

<p>Emily had a little hammock slung beside his own&mdash;the
books in which he taught her made a large part of his library;
and he who had seen her kneel beside her father to lisp her
childish prayer, or who had heard the simple, beautiful faith
with which she commended herself to the care of her Father in
Heaven, when the waves roared and the winds howled around
her floating home, would have felt, perhaps, that the most important
end of life, the cultivation of those affections that connect
us with God and with our fellow-creatures, might be attained as
perfectly there as elsewhere.</p>

<p>The astonishment of Captain Durbin and the pity of his
gentle child may be conceived, at the sight of the poor boy, who
was brought up from the boat by his captor and owner, as he
considered himself, and laid at their feet, while they sat together
in their cabin&mdash;he writing in his log-book, and she conning her
evening lesson. To the proposition that he should give the
prize so strangely obtained a free passage, and share in the
advantages to be gained by its exhibition in America, Captain
Durbin replied by showing the disappointed seaman the impossibility
of the object of these speculations being some product
of Nature's freaks&mdash;some hitherto unknown animal, with the
form, but without the faculties of man.</p>

<p>"Do you not see that he has clothes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Clothes do ye call them!" interrupted the blunt sailor,<a class='page' name ='Page_82' id='Page_82' title='82'>&nbsp;</a>
touching the pieces of cloth that hung around, but no longer
covered the thin limbs.</p>

<p>"Rags, perhaps I had better say&mdash;but the rags have been
clothes, woven and sewn by man's hands&mdash;so he must have
lived among men&mdash;civilized men&mdash;and he has grown but little,
as you may perceive, since those clothes were made&mdash;therefore,
he cannot have been long on the island."</p>

<p>"But how did he get there? Who'd leave a baby like this
there by himself?"</p>

<p>"That we may never know, for the boy must either be an
idiot&mdash;which he does not look like, however&mdash;or insane, or
dumb&mdash;but let that be as it will, we will do our duty by him,
and I thank God for having sent us here in time to save him."</p>

<p>The master of the ship usually gives the tone to those whom
he commands, and Captain Durbin found no difficulty in
obtaining the help of his men in his kind intentions to the boy
so strangely brought amongst them. By kind, yet rough
hands, he was washed, his hair was cut and combed, and a
suit of clean, though coarse garments, hastily fitted to him by
the best tailor among them&mdash;fitted, not with the precision of
Stultz certainly, but sufficiently well to enable him to walk in
them without danger of walking on them or of leaving them
behind. But he showed no intention of availing himself of
these capabilities. Wherever they carried him he went without
resistance&mdash;wherever they placed him he remained&mdash;he ate the
food that was offered him&mdash;but no word escaped his lips, no
voluntary movement was made by him, no look marked his
consciousness of aught that passed before him. He had again
assumed his only shield from violence&mdash;cunning. He could
account in no way for his being left unmolested, except from
the belief, freely expressed before him, that nature, by depriving
him of intelligence, or of speech, had unfitted him for labor, and
he resolved to do nothing that should unsettle that belief. But<a class='page' name ='Page_83' id='Page_83' title='83'>&nbsp;</a>
he found it more difficult than he had supposed it would be to
preserve this resolution, for he was subjected to the action of a
more potent influence than any he had yet encountered&mdash;kindness.
All were ready to show him this in its common forms,
but none so touchingly or so tenderly as the little Emily Durbin.
It was a beautiful sight to see that gentle child, with eyes blue
as the heavens, whose pure and lovely spirit they seemed to
mirror, gazing up at the dark boy as though she hoped to catch
some ray of the awakening spirit flitting over the handsome but
stolid features. Sometimes she would sit beside him, take his
hand in hers, or stroke gently the dark locks that began again
to hang in neglected curls around his face, and speak to him in
the tenderest accents, saying, "I love you very much, pretty
boy, and my father loves you too, and we all love you&mdash;don't
you love us?&mdash;but you can't tell me&mdash;I forgot that&mdash;never
mind, I'll ask our Heavenly Father to make you talk. Don't
you know Jesus made the dumb to speak when he was here on
earth? Did you ever hear about it? Poor boy! you can't
answer me&mdash;but I'll tell you all about it:" and then in her
sweet words and pitying voice she would tell of the Saviour of
men&mdash;how he had made the deaf to hear and the dumb to
speak, and she would repeat his lessons of love, dwelling often
on her favorite text, "This is my commandment, that ye love
one another&mdash;even as I have loved you, that ye also love one
another."</p>

<p>Thus by this babe, God was in his love leading the chilled
heart of that poor, desolate boy, back to himself&mdash;to hope&mdash;to
heaven. It was impossible that the dew of mercy should thus,
day by day and hour by hour, distil upon a spirit indurated by
man's cruelties, without softening it. Edward Hallett began to
love that sweet child, to listen to her step and voice, to gaze
upon her fair face, to return her loving looks, and to long to
tell her all his story. Emily became aware of the new<a class='page' name ='Page_84' id='Page_84' title='84'>&nbsp;</a>
expression in his face, and redoubled her manifestations of
interest. She entreated that he should be brought in when
her father read the Bible and prayed with her, night and
morning. "Who knows, it may be that our Heavenly Father
will make him hear us," was her simple and pathetic response
to Captain Durbin's assurance that it was useless, as he either
could not or would not understand them. Never had Edward
Hallett's resolution been more severely tried than when he saw
her kneel, with clasped hands and uplifted face, at her father's
knee, and heard her pray in her own simple words that "God
would bless the poor little dumb boy whom he had sent to
them, and that he would make him speak, and give him a
good heart, that he might love them." Captain Durbin turned
his eyes upon the object of her prayer at that moment, and he
almost thought that his lips moved, and was quite certain that
his eyes glistened with emotion. From this time he was as
anxious as Emily herself for the attendance of the strange boy
at their devotions.</p>

<p>For many weeks the ship had sped across that southern
sea with light and favoring breezes, but at length there came a
storm. The heavens were black with clouds&mdash;the wind swept
furiously over the ocean, and drove its wild waves in tremendous
masses against the reeling ship. Captain Durbin was a bold
sailor, as we have said, and he had weathered many a storm in
his trim barque; but Emily knew by the way in which he pressed
her to his heart this night, before he laid her, not in her
hammock, but on the narrow floor of his state-room, and by
the tone in which he ejaculated, "God bless you, and take care
of you, my beloved child!"&mdash;that there was more danger tonight
than they had ever before encountered together; and as
he was leaving her she drew him back and said, "Father, I
can't sleep, and I should like to talk to the little dumb boy;
won't you bring him here, and let him sit on my mattress with
me?"</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_85' id='Page_85' title='85'>&nbsp;</a>Captain Durbin brought Edward Hallett and placed him
beside Emily, where, by bracing themselves against the wall of
the state-room, they might prevent their being dashed about by
the rolling of the vessel. Emily welcomed him with an affectionate
smile, and taking his hand, which now sometimes answered
the clasp of hers, told him that he must not be afraid,
though there was a great storm, for their Father in Heaven
could deliver them out of it if it were His will, and if it were
not, He would take them to himself, if they loved Him, and
loved one another as the blessed Saviour had commanded them.
"And you know we must die some way," continued the sweet
young preacher, "and father says it is just as easy to go to
Heaven from the sea as from any other place." She paused a
moment, and then added in a low tone, "But I think I had
rather die on shore, and be buried by my mother in the green,
shady church-yard&mdash;it is so quiet there."</p>

<p>Emily crept nearer and nearer to her young companion as
she spoke, with that clinging to human love and care which is
felt by the hardest breast in moments of dread. His heart was
beating high with the tenderest and the happiest emotions he
had ever known, when a wave sweeping over the deck of the
ship, and breaking through the skylight, came tumbling in
upon them. It forced them asunder, and the falling of their
lantern at the same moment left them in darkness amidst the
tossing of the ship, the rolling of the furniture, and the noise of
the many waters. Edward Hallett's first thought was for
Emily;&mdash;he felt for her on every side, but she was not in the
state-room; he groped his way into the cabin, but he could not
find her, and he heard no sound that told of her existence. In
terror for her, self was forgotten&mdash;love conquered fear, as it had
already obtained the empire over hate, and he called her&mdash;"Emily&mdash;dear
Emily!&mdash;hear me&mdash;answer me, Emily?"</p>

<p>He listened in vain for the faint voice for which he thirsted.<a class='page' name ='Page_86' id='Page_86' title='86'>&nbsp;</a>
Suddenly he bounded up the cabin steps and rushed to the post
at which he knew Captain Durbin was most likely to be found
in such a scene, crying as he went, "Emily! Emily! oh bring
a light and look for Emily!"</p>

<p>The shrill cry of a human heart in agony was heard above
the bellowing of the winds and the rush of the waves, and without
waiting for a question, without heeding even the miracle
that the dumb had spoken, Captain Durbin hastened below,
followed by his agitated summoner. As quickly as his trembling
hands permitted, he struck a light and looked around for
his child. She had been dashed against a chest, and lay pale
and seemingly lifeless, with the red blood oozing slowly from a
cut in the temple. Edward Hallett had lifted her before Captain
Durbin could lay aside his light, and as he approached him,
looking up with a face almost as pale as that which lay upon his
arm, he exclaimed, "Oh, sir, surely she is not dead!"</p>

<p>It was not till Emily had again opened her soft eyes and assured
her father that she was not much hurt, that any notice
was taken of the very unusual fact of Edward Hallett's speaking.</p>

<p>"Father, how did you know I was hurt?"</p>

<p>"He whom we have thought a dumb boy called me, and
told me he could not find you," said Captain Durbin, looking
earnestly, almost sternly at Edward, who colored as he felt
that eyes he dared not meet were upon him. But the gentle,
loving Emily took his hand, and said, "Did our good Heavenly
Father make you speak?&mdash;I am so glad&mdash;please speak to
me!"</p>

<p>Edward could not raise his eyes to hers, but covering his
face with his other hand, he fell on his knees, saying to her and
Captain Durbin, "I am afraid it was very wicked, but indeed I
couldn't help it. I could speak all the time, Emily, but I was
afraid of being beaten as I used to be, if I seemed like other<a class='page' name ='Page_87' id='Page_87' title='87'>&nbsp;</a>
people&mdash;now if they beat me I must bear it&mdash;better for me
to be beaten than to have Emily lie there with no one to help
her."</p>

<p>"But who is going to beat you? Nobody will beat you&mdash;we
all love you&mdash;don't we, father?" cried Emily, bending forward
and putting her arm around the neck of her <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>"We must hear first whether he is worthy of our love, my
dear," said Captain Durbin, as he attempted to withdraw his
daughter's arm, and to make her lie down again&mdash;but Edward
had seized the little hand and held it around his neck, while he
exclaimed in the most imploring tones, "Oh, sir I let Emily
love me&mdash;nobody else except my poor mother ever loved me.
Beat me as much as you please, and I will not say a word, but
oh! pray, sir! don't tell Emily she must not love me."</p>

<p>"And, father, if he were wicked, you know you told me
once that we must love the wicked and try to do them good,
because our Father in Heaven loved us while we were yet
sinners," urged Emily.</p>

<p>That gentle voice could not be unheeded, and as Captain
Durbin kissed her, he laid his hand kindly on the boy's head,
saying in more friendly tones, "I hope he has not been wicked,
but we will hear more about it to-morrow&mdash;I cannot stay
longer with you now, and you must lie still just where I have
put you, or you may roll out and get hurt. We shall have a
rough sea most of the night, though, thank God! no danger,
for the wind had shifted and slackened a little before that great
wave swept you away!"</p>

<p>"May I not stay by Emily, sir, and tell her what made me
not speak? I will not let her sit up again."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! do, father, let him stay till you come down
again."</p>

<p>Captain Durbin consented, and when he came down again at
midnight from the deck, the children had both fallen asleep, but<a class='page' name ='Page_88' id='Page_88' title='88'>&nbsp;</a>
their hands were clasped in each other's, and the flushed cheeks
and dewy lashes of both showed that they had been weeping.
The next morning Captain Durbin heard the story of the orphan
boy. Emily Durbin stood beside him while he told it,
and he needed the courage which her presence gave him, for
his cowed spirit could not yet rise to confidence in man. The
mingled indignation and pity with which Captain Durbin heard
the simple but touching narrative of his life&mdash;the earnest kindness
with which, at the conclusion, he drew him to his side,
and told him that he would be his father, and Emily his sister,
adding, "God gave you to me, and as His gift I will love you
and care for you," first taught him that his friend Emily was
not the one only angel of mercy in our world. As time passed
on, and Captain Durbin kept well the promise of those words,
instructing him with care and guarding him with tenderness
as well as with fidelity, his faith became firm, not only in his
fellow-men, but in Him who had brought such great good for
him out of the darkest evil. His long repressed affections
sprang into vigorous growth, his intellect expanded rapidly in
their glow, his eye grew bright, his step elastic, and his whole
air redolent of a joy which none but those who have suffered
as he had done can conceive. In the handsome youth who
returned two years afterwards with Captain Durbin to Boston,
and who walked so proudly at his side, leading Emily by the
hand, few could have recognized the wild boy of that western
Island.</p>

<p>Such was the transformation which the spirit of love, breathing
itself through the lips of a little child, had effected. "Verily,
of such" children "is the kingdom of heaven."</p>

<p>The entertainment of the evening gave its character to our conversation
on the following morning. It was a conversation too
grave for introduction into a work intended only to aid in the
entertainment of festive hours: it commenced with the English
"poor-laws," and ended with a discussion of the tenure of property
in that land, and the wisdom of our own republican fathers
in abolishing entails&mdash;a subject affording a fair opportunity to
us Americans, to indulge a little in that self-glorification which
we are accused of loving so well.</p>

<p>"What a curious book would a 'History of Entails' be!"
exclaimed Mr. Arlington, "how full of the romance of life!"</p>

<p>"Romance!" ejaculated Annie.</p>

<p>"Yes, romance; for under this system, the poor man, whose
life seemed doomed to one unbroken struggle with fortune, for
the necessaries of existence, finds himself, by some unexpected
casualty, the possessor of rank, and of what seems to him boundless
wealth."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" said I, "but you have given us only the bright
side of the picture. To make room for this stranger, whose
only connection with the house of which he has so unexpectedly
become the head is probably that preserved in genealogical
tables, the daughters of the house, or their children it may
be, reared in luxury, must go forth to a life of comparative privation.
I met, some years ago, in one of my visits to the Far<a class='page' name ='Page_90' id='Page_90' title='90'>&nbsp;</a>
West, a young Englishman, who&mdash;but I will read you the
story of his life, as I wrote it out soon after parting with him."</p>

<p>"Have you a picture of him, Aunt Nancy?" asked Robert
Dudley.</p>

<p>"Yes, Robert," I replied with a smile, "but you must have
patience, for I shall neither show the picture nor tell the story
till evening."</p>

<p>When we were assembled in the evening, Annie, with much
ceremony, led me to the high-backed arm-chair, which she called
the Speaker's Chair, and placed before me the small travelling
desk, in which she knew my manuscripts were kept. I
unlocked it, and soon found the scroll of which I was in search.</p>

<p>"But the picture, Aunt Nancy&mdash;where is the picture?"
cried the eager Robert.</p>

<p>"Here it is," I cried, as I loosened the ribbon with which
the manuscript was bound together, and produced a small engraving;
a fancy subject, however, rather than an actual portrait,
and of no general interest. The print was eagerly caught
by Robert, and handed around the circle, with exclamations of,
"How handsome!" "What an exquisite picture!" Mr. Arlington
looked at it a moment, then, with a smiling glance at
me, handed it, without a word of comment, to Col. Donaldson.</p>

<p>"The impertinent puppy!" ejaculated the Colonel, "engrossed
with his hawk and his hound, and wearing such an
insolent air of self-absorption in the presence of a lady" (for
the artist had introduced a lovely young maiden in the scene).
"Poor girl!" continued the Colonel; "if she were in any way
connected with him, I am not surprised that she should look so
sad and reproachful."</p>

<p>Mr. Arlington's smiling glance was again turned on me;
and I met it with a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>"Indeed, Aunt Nancy," said the Colonel, who seemed
strangely annoyed at my laughter, "I think your friend does<a class='page' name ='Page_91' id='Page_91' title='91'>&nbsp;</a>
you little credit, and I can only hope that he had some of
these lordly airs drubbed out of him at the West."</p>

<p>As Col. Donaldson spoke he threw down the engraving
which he had held, and pushed his chair from the table.</p>

<p>"I assure you, sir," I replied, "my friend has as few lordly
airs as it is possible to conceive in one born to such lordly circumstances.
It was not my intention to impose on you that
picture as an actual likeness of him&mdash;though had you ever
seen him I might easily have done so, as it really resembles
him very much in his personal traits."</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad he did not sit for this picture," said Col.
Donaldson; "now I can listen to your story with some
pleasure."</p>

<p>"Thank you; you must first take some reflections suggested
to me by the incidents I have here narrated. Of the character
of these reflections, you will form some conception from
the title I have given to the tale into which I have interwoven
them. I have called it</p>


<h3><a name="LIFE_IN_AMERICA" id="LIFE_IN_AMERICA"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">"LIFE IN AMERICA."</a></h3>

<p>"Men and Manners in America" was the comprehensive title
of a book issued some fifteen or twenty years ago, by a gentleman
from Scotland, to whom, we fear, Americans have never
tendered the grateful acknowledgments he deserved for his disinterested
efforts to teach them to eat eggs properly, and to
give due time to the mastication of their food. This benevolently
instructive work was the precursor of a host of others on
the same topics, and others of a kindred character. America
has been the standard subject for the trial essays of European
tyros in philosophy, political economy, and book-making in
general. Society in America has been presented, it would
seem, in all its aspects&mdash;religious, educational, industrial, politi<a class='page' name ='Page_92' id='Page_92' title='92'>&nbsp;</a>cal,
commercial, and fashionable. Our schools and our prisons,
our churches and our theatres, have been in turn the subject of
investigation, of unqualified censure, and of scarcely less unqualified
laudation.</p>

<p>The subject thus dissected, put together, and dissected
again, has not been able to restrain some wincing and an occasional
outcry, when the scalpel has been held by a more than
usually unskilful hand&mdash;demonstrations of sensibility which
have occasioned apparently as much disapprobation as surprise
in the anatomists. We flatter ourselves that there is peculiar
fitness in the metaphor just used, for the outer form only of
American life has been touched by these various writers. Its
spirit, that which gives to it its peculiar organization, has evaded
them as completely as the soul of man evades the keenest investigations
of the dissecting room. Even of the seat of the spirit&mdash;of
the point whence it sends forth its subtle influences, giving
activity and direction to every member&mdash;of the <span class="smcap">homes</span> of
America, they have little real knowledge. The anatomist&mdash;the
reader will pardon the continuation of a figure so illustrative
of our meaning&mdash;the anatomist knows that not only can he
never hope to lay his finger upon the principle of life, but that
ere he can pry into those cells in which its mysterious processes
are evolved, they must have been dismantled of all that could
have guided him to any certain deductions respecting its nature
and mode of action. And seldom is the eye of the stranger,
never that of the professed bookmaker, suffered to rest upon
our homes till they have undergone changes that will as completely
baffle his penetration. Nor is this always designedly.
It is from a delicate instinct which shrinks from subjecting its
most sacred and touching emotions to the rude gaze and ruder
comment of the world.</p>

<p>We have been led to these observations by certain events
of which we have lately become informed, and which we would<a class='page' name ='Page_93' id='Page_93' title='93'>&nbsp;</a>
here record, as illustrative of some peculiarities of social life in
America, and especially of the new development of character
manifested by women under the influence of these peculiarities.</p>

<p>The ringing of bells, the firing of cannon, the huzzaing of
the assembling multitude on the announcement in London of
the victory of Waterloo, must have seemed a bitter mockery to
many a heart, mad with the first sharp agony of bereavement.
"The few must suffer that the many may rejoice," say the
statesman and the warrior while they plan new conquests. It
may be so, but we have at present to do with the sufferings of
the few.</p>

<p>On the list of the killed in that battle appeared the name
of Horace Danforth, Captain in the 41st Regiment of Infantry.
It was a name of little note, but there was one to whom it was
the synonyme of all that gave beauty or gladness to life; and
ere the bells had ceased to sound, or the eager crowd to huzza,
her heart was still. With her last quivering sigh had mingled
the wail of a new-born infant.</p>

<p>Thus was Horace Maitland Danforth ushered into life. He
had been born at the house of his maternal uncle, Sir Thomas
Maitland, and as his mother had been wholly dependent on
this gentleman, and his father had been a soldier of fortune,
leaving to his son no heritage but his name, he continued there,
as carefully reared and tenderly regarded as though he had been
the heir to Maitland Park and to all its dependencies. Though
Sir Thomas had, for many years after the birth of his nephew
intended to marry, it was an intention never executed, and when
Horace attained his twenty-first birthday, his majority was celebrated
as that of his uncle's heir, and as such he was presented
by Sir Thomas Maitland to his assembled tenantry. Soon
after this event, the Baronet obtained for his nephew a right to
the name and arms of Maitland&mdash;a measure to which, knowing
little of his father's family, Horace readily consented. Sir<a class='page' name ='Page_94' id='Page_94' title='94'>&nbsp;</a>
Thomas Maitland died suddenly while yet in the prime of life,
and was succeeded by Sir Horace, then twenty-four years of
age. In the enjoyments of society, of travel, and of those
thousand luxuries, mental and physical, which fortune secures,
three years passed rapidly away with the young, handsome,
and accomplished Baronet.</p>

<p>One of the earliest convictions of Horace Maitland's life
had been, that the refining presence of woman was necessary
to the perfection of Maitland Park, and when Sir Thomas said
to him, "Marry, Horace&mdash;do not be an old bachelor like your
uncle"&mdash;though he answered nothing, he vowed in the inmost
recesses of his heart that it should not be his fault if he did
not obey the injunction. Yet to the world it seemed wholly
his own fault that at twenty-seven he had not given to Maitland
Park a mistress, and even he himself could not attribute
his continued celibacy to the coldness or cruelty of woman;
for, in truth, though he had "knelt at many a shrine," he had
"laid his heart on none." If hardly pressed for his reason, he
might have said with Ferdinand,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"For several virtues<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have I liked several women; never any<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With so full soul, but some defect in her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did quarrel with the noblest grace she own'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And put it to the foil."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He who after the death of his uncle continued to urge Sir
Horace most on the subject of matrimony, was the one of all
the world who might have been supposed least desirous to see
him enter into its bonds. This was Edward Maitland, a distant
cousin, somewhat younger than himself, to whom he had
been attached from his boyhood, and who had been saved by
his generosity from many of those painful experiences to which
a very narrow income would otherwise have subjected him. It
had more than once been suggested to Edward Maitland, that<a class='page' name ='Page_95' id='Page_95' title='95'>&nbsp;</a>
should his cousin die unmarried, he might not unreasonably
hope to become his heir, as he was supposed to be uncontrolled
by any entail in the disposal of his property, and had few
nearer relations than himself, and none with whom he maintained
such intimate and affectionate intercourse. Nor could
Edward Maitland fail to perceive that his own value in society
was in an inverse ratio to the chances of the Baronet's marrying,
as a report of an actual proposal on the part of the latter
had more than once occasioned a visible declension in the number
and warmth of his invitations. These considerations appeared,
however, only to stimulate the young man's activity in
the search of a wife for his cousin. Had he been employed
by a marriage broker with a prospect of a liberal commission,
he could hardly have been more indefatigable.</p>

<p>"Well, Horace," exclaimed the younger Maitland, as the
two sat loitering over a late London breakfast one morning,
"how did you like the lady to whom I introduced you last
evening?"</p>

<p>A smile lighted the eyes of Sir Horace as he replied, "Very
much, Ned&mdash;she is certainly intelligent, and has read and
thought more than most ladies of her age."</p>

<p>"She will make a capital manager, I am sure."</p>

<p>"And an agreeable companion," added Sir Horace.</p>

<p>"And a good wife&mdash;do you not think so, Horace?"</p>

<p>"She doubtless would be to one who could fancy her,
Ned; for me her style is a little too <i>prononc&eacute;</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, really, Horace, I cannot imagine what you would
have. One woman is too frivolous&mdash;another wants refinement&mdash;one
is too indolent and exacting&mdash;and when you can make
no other objection, why her style is a little too <i>prononc&eacute;</i>"&mdash;the
last words were given with ludicrous imitation of his cousin's
tone. "If an angel were to descend from heaven for you,
I doubt if you would be suited."</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_96' id='Page_96' title='96'>&nbsp;</a>"So do I," replied Horace, with a gay laugh at his cousin's
evident vexation.</p>

<p>And thus did he meet all Edward's well-intended efforts.
The power of choice had made him fastidious, and his life of
luxury and freedom had brought him no experiences of the
need of another and gentler self as a consoler. But that lesson
was approaching.</p>

<p>A call from his lawyer for some papers necessary to complete
an arrangement in which he was much interested, had
sent Sir Horace to Maitland Park, in the midst of the London
season, to explore the yet unfathomed recesses of an old <i>escritoire</i>
of Sir Thomas. He had been gone but two days when
Edward received the following note from him, written, as it
seemed, both in haste and agitation:&mdash;</p>


<p>"Come to me immediately on the receipt of this, dear Edward.
I have found here a paper of the utmost importance to
you as well as to me. Come quickly&mdash;take the chariot and
travel post.</p>

<p>
"Yours,        H.&nbsp;D. <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>."<br />
</p>


<p>In less than an hour after the reception of this note Edward
Maitland was on the road: and travelling with the utmost expedition,
he arrived at Maitland Park just as the day was fading
into dusky eve.</p>

<p>"How is Sir Horace?" he asked of the man who admitted
him.</p>

<p>"I do not think he seems very well, sir. You will find him
in the library, Mr. Edward&mdash;shall I announce you, sir?"</p>

<p>"No;" and with hurried steps and anxious heart Edward
Maitland trod the well-known passages leading to the library.</p>

<p>When he entered that room, Sir Horace was standing at
one of its windows gazing upon the landscape without, and
so absorbed was he that he did not move at the opening of the
door. Edward spoke, and starting, he turned towards him a<a class='page' name ='Page_97' id='Page_97' title='97'>&nbsp;</a>
face haggard with some yet untold suffering. He advanced to
meet his cousin, and with an almost convulsive grasp of the
hand, said, "I am glad you have come, Edward,"&mdash;then, without
heeding the anxious inquiries addressed to him by Edward,
he rang the bell, and ordered lights in a tone which caused them
to be brought without a moment's delay. As soon as the servant
who had brought them had left the room, Horace resumed:
"Now, Edward, here is the paper of which I wrote to you;
read it at once."</p>

<p>Agitated by his cousin's manner, Edward took the old
stained paper from him without a word, and seating himself
near the lights, began to read, while Sir Horace stood just opposite
him, eyeing him intently. In a very few minutes Edward
looked up with a puzzled air and said, "I do not understand
one word of it. What does it all mean, Horace?"</p>

<p>"It means that you are Sir Edward Maitland&mdash;that you
are master here&mdash;and that I am a beggar."</p>

<p>"Horace, you are mad!" exclaimed the young man, starting
from his chair, with quivering limbs and a face from which
every trace of color had departed.</p>

<p>Hitherto the tone in which Sir Horace had spoken, the
alternate flush and pallor on his face, and the shiver that occasionally
passed over his frame, had shown him to be fearfully
excited; but as Edward became agitated, all these signs of
emotion passed away, and with wonderful calmness taking the
paper in his hand, he commenced reading that part of it which
explained its purpose. This was to secure the descent of the
baronetcy of Maitland and the property attached to it in the
male line. Having made Edward Maitland comprehend this
purpose, Sir Horace drew towards him a genealogical table of
their family, and showed him that he was himself the only living
descendant in a direct line through an unbroken succession
of males from the period at which this entail was made.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_98' id='Page_98' title='98'>&nbsp;</a>"And now, Edward," he said in conclusion, "I am prepared
to give up every thing to you. That you have so long
been defrauded of your rights has been through ignorance on
my part, and equal ignorance, I am convinced, on the part of
my uncle. You know he paid little attention to business, leaving
it wholly to his agents. I have often heard him express a
wish to examine the papers in the old <i>escritoire</i> in which I found
this deed, saying that they had been sent home by old Harris
when he gave up his business to his nephew&mdash;the old man
writing to my uncle, that as they consisted of leases that had
fallen in, or of antiquated deeds, they were no longer of any
value except as family records. It was a just Providence that
led me to that <i>escritoire</i>, to search for the missing title-deeds of
the farm I was about to sell."</p>

<p>Edward Maitland had sunk into his chair from sheer inability
to stand, and for several minutes after his cousin had
ceased speaking, he still sat, with his elbows resting on the table
before him, and his face buried in his clasped hands. At length
looking up, he said, "Horace, let us burn this paper and forget
it."</p>

<p>"Forget! that is impossible, Edward."</p>

<p>"Why?&mdash;why not live as we have done? You speak of
defrauding me, but what have I wanted that you had? Has
not your purse been as my own? Your home&mdash;has it not been
mine? It shall be so still. We shall share the fortune, and as
to the title, you will wear it more gracefully than I."</p>

<p>"Dear Edward! Such proof of your generous affection
ought to console me for all changes, and it shall. I will confess
to you that I have suffered, but it is past. My people&mdash;&mdash;"
his voice faltered, his chest heaved, and turning away he walked
more than once across the room before he resumed&mdash;"they
are mine no longer&mdash;but you will be kind to them, Edward, I
know."</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_99' id='Page_99' title='99'>&nbsp;</a>"Horace, you will drive me mad!" cried Edward Maitland.
"Promise, I conjure you, promise me to say nothing
more of this."</p>

<p>He threw himself as he spoke into his cousin's arms with
an agitation which Horace vainly sought to soothe, until he promised
"to <i>speak</i>" no further on this subject at present to any
one. Satisfied with this promise, and exhausted by the emotions
of the last hour, Edward soon retired to his own room. It
was long before he slept, and had he not been in a distant part
of the house, he would have heard the hurried steps with
which, for many an hour after he was left alone, Sir Horace
Maitland continued to pace the floor of the dimly lighted
library. The clock was on the stroke of three when he seated
himself and began the following letter:</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dear Edward</span>:&mdash;I must go, and at once. I cannot without
the loss of self-respect continue to play the master here another
day, neither can I live as a dependent within these walls&mdash;no,
not for an hour. Do not attempt to follow me, for I will
not see you. I will write to you as soon as I arrive at my
point of destination&mdash;I know not yet where that will be. Feel
no anxiety about me. I shall take with me a thousand pounds,
and will leave an order for Decker to receive from you and hold
subject to my draft whatever sum may accrue from the sale, at
a fair valuation, of Sir Thomas Maitland's personal property,
which he had an undoubted right to will as he pleased, the
amount of the mesne rents expended by me during the last three
years having been deducted therefrom. Do not attempt to
force favors upon me, Edward&mdash;I cannot bear them now.
Such attempts would only compel me to cut myself loose from
you and your affection&mdash;the one blessing that earth still holds
for me.</p>

<p>My trunks have been packed two days, for my first re<a class='page' name ='Page_100' id='Page_100' title='100'>&nbsp;</a>solve
was to go from this place and from England. I shall take
the chariot in which you came down and fresh horses, but I will
send them back to you from London.</p>

<p>God bless you, Edward. I dare not speak of my feelings to
you now, lest I should lose the strength and self-command I
need so much. God bless you.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">H.&nbsp;D. Maitland.</span><br />
</p>


<p>Stealthily did Sir Horace move through the wide halls and
ascend the lofty stairs of this home of his life, feeling at every
step the rushing tide of memory conflicting with the sad thought
that he was treading them for the last time. Having reached
his sleeping apartments, he rang a bell which he knew would
summon his own man. Rapidly as the man moved, the time
seemed long to him ere the summons was obeyed, and he had
given the necessary orders to have the carriage prepared and
the trunks brought down as soon as possible, "and as quietly,"
he added, "as he did not wish to disturb Mr. Edward, who had
retired to bed late."</p>

<p>"Will you not take breakfast, sir, before you set out?" asked
the man.</p>

<p>"No, John. Let the carriage follow me. I shall walk on.
Be quick, and make no noise."</p>

<p>A faint streak of light was just beginning to appear in the
east, when the heretofore master of that lordly mansion went
out into a world which held for him no other home. <span class="smcap">Accident</span>,
as short-sighted mortals name events controlled by no
human will, decided whither he should direct his course from
London. He had called at his lawyer's&mdash;the already mentioned
"nephew of old Harris"&mdash;determined to communicate his
discovery to him, perhaps with some faint hope of learning that
the entail had been in some way set aside, before Sir Thomas
had ventured to make his sister's son his heir. Mr. Decker was<a class='page' name ='Page_101' id='Page_101' title='101'>&nbsp;</a>
not in his rooms, and sitting down to wait for him he took up
mechanically the morning paper that lay on his table. The first
thing on which his eye rested was the advertisement of a steam
packet about to sail from Liverpool for America.</p>

<p>"America; the very place for me. I shall meet no acquaintances
there," was the thought which flashed through his
mind. Another glance at the paper of the day and hour of the
packet's sailing, an examination of his watch, an impatient look
from the window up and down the street, and again he mused,
"I have not a moment to spare, and if I wait for Decker I
may be kept for hours, and so lose the packet; and why should
I wait? Have I not seen the deed? This indecision is folly."</p>

<p>The result of these reflections was a note rapidly written to
Mr. Decker, stating his discovery of the deed of entail, his consequent
surrender of all claim to the property to Edward Maitland,
and his determination to quit England immediately. All
arrangements respecting the settlement of his claims on the
estate, and the claims of the present proprietor upon him, he
left to Sir Edward and Mr. Decker, empowering the latter to
receive and retain for his use and subject to his order, whatever,
on such a settlement, should appertain to him.</p>

<p>This note was left on Mr. Decker's table, and in one hour
after leaving his office Horace Maitland was advancing to
Liverpool with the rapidity of steam. The packet waited but
the arrival of the train in which he was a passenger, to leave the
shores of England. With what bitterness he watched those
receding shores, while memory wrote upon his bare and bleeding
heart the record of joys identified with them, and fading
like them for ever from his life, let each imagine for himself, for
to such emotions no language can do justice.</p>

<p>A voyage across the Atlantic is now too common an event
to stay, even for a moment, the pen of a narrator. From Boston,
Horace&mdash;no longer Sir Horace&mdash;wrote to his cousin as
follows&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_102' id='Page_102' title='102'>&nbsp;</a><span class="smcap">Dear Edward</span>&mdash;Here I am among the republicans, with
whom I may flatter myself I have lost nothing by sinking Sir
Horace Maitland into plain Mr. Danforth. Such is now my
address, assumed not from fear that in this distant quarter of
the world I shall meet any to whom the name of Maitland
is familiar but because much of which I do not desire to be reminded
is associated with that came. I said to you when
leaving my home, dear Edward, "Do not fear for me." I can
now repeat this with better reason. The first stunning shock
of the change to which I was so suddenly subjected has been
borne. My past life already seems to me as a dream from
which I have been rudely but effectually awakened. I am now
first to begin life in reality.</p>

<p>The accident which determined me to seek these shores was
a happy one. I cannot well dream here where all around me
is active, vigorous life. We are accustomed in England to
think of the American shores as the Ultima Thule in a western
direction, but when we reach these shores we find that the
movement is still west. The daily papers are filled with
accounts of persons migrating west, and thither am I going.
"The world is all before me where to choose" the theatre of
my new life&mdash;my life of work&mdash;-and I would have it far from
the blue sea, out of hearing of the murmur of the waves that
lave my island home. I will go where the wide prairies sweep
away on every side of the horizon&mdash;where every link with other
lands will be severed, and America below and Heaven above
constitute my universe. "You will find no society at the
West," has been said to me. This is another attraction to that
region. I would work out my destiny in solitude. I desire to
travel without company, and have made my arrangements accordingly.
I have purchased three substantial horses for a little
more than one hundred pounds, and have engaged a shrewd,
active lad as groom, valet, and he seems to think, companion,<a class='page' name ='Page_103' id='Page_103' title='103'>&nbsp;</a>
at about two pounds per month. A very light carriage, sometimes
driven by my servant and sometimes by myself, will
transport the moderate wardrobe which I shall deem it necessary
to take with me to the outermost verge of civilization and good
roads, where leaving carriage and wardrobe, or at least all of
the latter which may not be borne by a led-horse, I shall penetrate
still further into the old forests of this New World. I
long to be alone with "Nature's full, free heart"&mdash;perchance,
there, my own may beat as of yore.</p>

<p>Farewell, dear Edward. You may hear of me next among
the Sacs and Foxes;&mdash;at present address H. Danforth, care of
G&mdash;&mdash; &amp; D&mdash;&mdash;, Merchants,&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; street, Boston.</p>

<p class='center'>Yours ever, H.</p>
<p class='right-indent'><span class="smcap">Danforth</span>.</p>
<p class='lettersig'>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A new external life had indeed opened upon this child of
luxury and conventional refinement. He whose movements
had been chronicled as matter of interest to the public, for
whose presence the "world" had postponed its f&ecirc;tes, might
now travel hundreds of miles without observation or inquiry.
He upon whose steps had waited a crowd of obsequious
attendants, now found himself with one follower, whose tone of
independence hardly permitted him to call him servant. In
cities, where he would still have been surrounded by those conventional
distinctions of which he had himself been deprived,
the sense of a great loss would have been ever present with him,
and the contrast with the past would have made the fairest
present to which he could now attain, desolate. But there
could be no comparison, and therefore no painful contrast,
between the wild life of the prairies and the ultra-civilization of
English aristocratic society. In the excitement and adventure
of the one, he hoped to forget the other. He sought to forget&mdash;not
to be resigned, to acquiesce. His inner life was unchanged.
He had been a dreamer&mdash;a pleasure-seeker&mdash;and a
dreamer and pleasure-seeker he continued, though the dreams<a class='page' name ='Page_104' id='Page_104' title='104'>&nbsp;</a>
and the pleasures must be wrought from new materials. To
sketch the progress of such a character through the shifting
scenes of his new existence&mdash;to observe him in his association
with the strong, daring, acute, but uncultivated denizens of our
frontier States&mdash;to stand with sympathizing heart beside him as
he first entered upon those unpeopled solitudes in whose silence
God speaks to the soul, is not permitted us at present. This
may be the work of another day; but now we must pass at
once with him from Boston to a scene within the confines of
Iowa. His carriage had been left behind, and for two days he
had been riding over a rolling country, whose grassy knolls,
dotted here and there with clumps of trees, brought occasionally
to his mind the park scenery of his own land. Early in this
day he had passed a farm with a comfortable house and substantial
out-buildings, but no dwelling of man had since
presented itself to him, though the sun was now low in the
western sky. Under ordinary circumstances this would have
been of little consequence, for he had already spent more than
one night in the open air without discomfort; but his attendant
had heard a distant muttering of thunder, and John Stacy was
not the lad to encounter without murmuring a night of storm
unsheltered. John's anxiety made him keen-sighted, and he
was the first to perceive and announce the approach of a rider.
We use the neutral term <i>rider</i> not without consideration, for he
was one in whom a certain ease of manner, and even an air of
command, contradicted the testimony of habiliments made and
worn after a fashion recognized nowhere as characteristic of the
<i>genus</i> gentleman. A courteous inquiry from Horace Danforth
respecting the nearest place at which a night's shelter might be
obtained, led to a cordial invitation to him to return with him
to his own house. It was an invitation not to be disregarded
under existing circumstances, and it was accepted with evident
pleasure both by master and man.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_105' id='Page_105' title='105'>&nbsp;</a>Mr. Grahame, for so the new-comer had announced himself,
led the way back for a short distance over the route just
pursued by our travellers, and then striking off to the left, rode
briskly forward for several miles. The light gray clouds which
had long been gathering in the western sky had deepened into
blackness as they proceeded, and flashes of lightning were
darting across their path, and large drops of rain were falling
upon them when they neared a house constructed of logs, yet
bearing some evidence of taste in the grounds around it, as well
as in its position, which was on the side of a gently sloping
hill, looking out upon a landscape through which wound a
clear and rapid, though narrow stream.</p>

<p>"Like good cavaliers, we will see our horses housed first,"
said Mr. Grahame, riding past the main building to one of the
out-houses, built also of logs, which served as a stable. Here
Horace Danforth relinquished his tired steed to the care of
John Stacy, and Mr. Grahame having himself rubbed down
his own beautiful animal, and thrown a bundle of hay before
him, with a slight apology to his visitor for the detention, led
the way into the house. As they entered the vacant parlor a
shade of something like dissatisfaction passed over the master's
countenance, and having seen his guest seated by a huge fireplace,
whose cheerful blaze of wood a chilly evening made by
no means unwelcome, he left him alone. He soon returned,
however, with a brighter expression, which was explained by
his saying, "I feared, on finding this room empty, that my
daughter had been sent for to a sick woman with whom she
has lately spent several days and nights, and that I could offer
you only the discomforts of a bachelor's establishment; but I
find she is at home, and will soon give us supper."</p>

<p>During the absence of his host, our Englishman had looked
around with increasing surprise at the contents of the parlor.
The furniture was of the most simple description, yet marked<a class='page' name ='Page_106' id='Page_106' title='106'>&nbsp;</a>
by a certain neatness and gracefulness of arrangement, indicative,
as he could not but think, of a cultivated taste. The same
mingling of even rude simplicity of material and tasteful
arrangement prevailed in the chamber to which his host now
conducted him, and where the luxury, for such he had learned
to regard it, of abundance of clear water and clean napkins
awaited him. In a few minutes after his return to the parlor a
door was opened, through which he obtained a view of an
inner apartment, well lighted, and containing a table so spread
as to present no slight temptation to a traveller who had not
broken his fast since the morning meal. At the head of this
table stood a young woman of graceful form, whom his host
introduced to him as his daughter, Miss Grahame.</p>

<p>Mary Grahame's clear complexion, glowing with the hue of
health, her large and soft and dark gray eyes, her abundant
glossy black hair, might have won from the most fastidious
some of that admiration given to personal beauty; but in truth
Horace Danforth had grown indifferent as well as fastidious,
and it was not until in after days he had seen the complexion
glow and the dark eyes kindle with feeling, that he said to himself,
"She is beautiful!" To the fascination of a peculiarly
graceful, gentle, yet earnest manner, he was, however, more
quickly susceptible. During this first evening, the chief emotion
excited in his mind was surprise at the style of conversation
and manner, the acquaintance with books and with <i>les
bien-s&eacute;ances</i> which marked these inhabitants of a log cabin in
the western wilds&mdash;these denizens of a half-savage life.</p>

<p>A day of hard riding had induced such fatigue, that even
the rare and unexpected pleasure of communication with refined
and cultivated minds, could not keep Horace Danforth long
from his pillow. As he expected to set out in the morning
very early, he would have made his adieus in parting for the
night, mingling with them courteous expressions of the enjoy<a class='page' name ='Page_107' id='Page_107' title='107'>&nbsp;</a>ment
which such society had afforded him after his long abstinence
from all intellectual converse.</p>

<p>"Believe me," said Mr. Graham, and the sentiment was
corroborated by his daughter's eyes, "the pleasure has been
mutual. Society is the great want of our western life. I have
been wishing to ask whether your business were too urgent to
permit you to afford us more of this coveted good?"</p>

<p>"I am ashamed to confess," said Horace Danforth, with
some embarrassment, "that I have no business at present&mdash;that
I am an idler&mdash;I verily believe the only one in your
country."</p>

<p>"Then will you not give us the pleasure of your company
for a longer time? A little rest will be no disadvantage either
to your horses or yourself, and on us you will be conferring a
favor which you cannot appreciate till you have lived five hundred
miles away from civilization."</p>

<p>The invitation was accepted as cordially as it was given,
to the great satisfaction of John Stacy, who had been much
pleased with the appearance of land in this neighborhood, and
wanted time to look about him preparatory to purchasing.</p>

<p>Horace Danforth awoke early next morning, and throwing
open the shutters of the only window in his room, found that a
stormy night had been succeeded by an unusually brilliant
morning. "To brush the dews from off the upland lawn" had
not been a habit of his past life; but the cool fresh air, the
spicy perfumes which it wafted to him, and the brightness and
verdure of the whole landscape, proved now more inviting than
his pillow; and dressing himself hastily, he descended the clean
but rude and uncarpeted stairs as gently as possible, lest he
should arouse Miss Grahame from her slumbers. He found
the front door open, showing that he was not the first of the
household to go abroad that day. As he stepped out upon the
lawn, he discovered that the parlor windows were also open,<a class='page' name ='Page_108' id='Page_108' title='108'>&nbsp;</a>
and a familiar air, hummed in low, suppressed tones, caused
him to look through them as he passed. Could he believe his
eyes? Was that neatest and prettiest of all housemaids, who,
moving with light and even graceful steps, was yet busied in
the very homely task of dusting and arranging the furniture in
the parlor&mdash;was she indeed the same Miss Grahame who had
last evening charmed him by her lady-like deportment and intelligent
conversation? Yes, the very same; for though the
glossy black braids were covered by a gay colored handkerchief
wound around her head <i>&agrave; la Turque</i>, there was the same wide
forehead and well-defined brows; the same soft dark gray eyes;
the same slightly aquiline nose and smiling mouth. Nor was
the conversation of last evening more opposed, in his imagination,
to her present employment, than the evident taste and
feeling with which she was now singing that most beautiful
hymn of the Irish poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O God! Thou art the life and light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all this wondrous world I see."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Listening and gazing, wondering and comparing, he had well
nigh forgotten himself, when the lady of the mansion turning
suddenly to the window, raised her head. Their eyes met!
The color which rushed quickly to her very temples, recalled
him to himself, and bowing with certainly not less embarrassment
than she evinced, he walked rapidly on. He had not proceeded
far, however, when he saw his host approaching from
an opposite direction. As Mr. Grahame had already spent
more than an hour in his fields, sharing as well as directing the
labors of his men, he expressed no surprise at meeting his guest
abroad. After a cordial greeting, and a few general observations
on the weather and scenery had been exchanged, Mr.
Grahame, glancing up at the sun, which had now risen considerably
above a distant wood, said, "I am sorry to interrupt
your walk, but my morning's work has made me by no means<a class='page' name ='Page_109' id='Page_109' title='109'>&nbsp;</a>
indifferent to my breakfast, and I think that Mary's coffee and
biscuits are about this time done to a turn."</p>

<p>A few minutes brought them back to the house, and into
the parlor from which Mary Grahame had disappeared, leaving
behind her, in its neat and tasteful arrangement, and in the
fresh flowers that adorned the table and mantelpiece, evidence
of her early presence. The gentlemen were soon summoned to
breakfast.</p>

<p>It may have been that his early rising had given to Horace
Danforth an unusual appetite; but certain it is that no breakfast
of which he had ever partaken seemed to him half so inviting
as this. And yet, in truth, it was simple enough; toast,
crisp and brown, warm, light biscuits, fresh eggs, good butter,
excellent coffee, and rich cream were all it offered. Mary Grahame
presided, and speaking little herself, listened to her father
and Horace, while they discussed the different characteristics of
English or European and American society, with a pleased and
intelligent countenance. Some observations from him drew
from Mr. Grahame the following reply:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is one feature of American society upon which I
think no foreigner has remarked, or if he have, it has been so
cursorily as plainly to show that he was far from appreciating
its importance: I mean the fact that here the thinker is also
the worker. In England and the European States, the working
class is distinct from the consumers, and there must be
almost as great a contrast in the intellectual as in the physical
condition of the two. All the refinement, the cultivation, must
remain with those who have leisure and fortune&mdash;as a class, I
mean, for individuals will of course be found, who, in spite of
all disadvantages, will rise to the highest position. But here,
in America, there are no idlers. Here, with few if any exceptions,
all must be, in some way, workers, and all may be thinkers.
We attain thus to a republic of mind."</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_110' id='Page_110' title='110'>&nbsp;</a>"Do you not fear that the result of this will be to check
the development of individual greatness; that as you have
no king in the State, so you will have no king in literature?"</p>

<p>"Even were this so, it would remain a question whether the
great increase of general intelligence would not more than compensate
the evil."</p>

<p>"Can many Polloks repay us for one Milton&mdash;many Drydens
for one Shakspeare?"</p>

<p>"You take extreme cases; besides, I only admitted your
supposition to show that I could produce a set-off to the disadvantage.
I do not believe that the necessity for labor of some
sort will prevent a truly great mind from achieving for itself
the highest distinction. I think the history of such minds
proves that it will rather serve as a stimulus to their powers."</p>

<p>Horace Danforth was silent, and after a moment's pause,
Mr. Grahame resumed.</p>

<p>"In this union of the working and the thinking classes, the
refinements of life, those things which adorn, and beautify it,
take their true place as consolers and soothers of the care-worn
and toil-wearied mind. No Italian opera can give such delight
to the sated man of pleasure as the tired laborer feels in
listening to the evening song with which some loved one, in
his home, sings him to repose.</p>

<p>"You speak <i>con amore</i>" said Horace Danforth, smiling at
his host's fervor.</p>

<p>"I do. Had I been excluded from the refinements of social
life, I should long since have fainted and grown weary of
my toil here. I felt this when compelled to relinquish my
daughter's society for two years, that she might have the advantage
of instruction in those branches of a womanly education
in which I could give her no aid."</p>

<p>"And having spent two years in the more cultivated East, did
Miss Grahame return willingly to her home in the wilderness?"</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_111' id='Page_111' title='111'>&nbsp;</a>This question was addressed to Mary Grahame herself, and
she answered simply, "My father was here."</p>

<p>"You acknowledge, then, that could your father have been
with you, you would have preferred remaining at the East?"</p>

<p>"Oh no! I was fifteen when my father sent me from home,
and they who have enjoyed the free life of the prairies so long,
seldom love cities."</p>

<p>"But the ease, the freedom from labor, which is enjoyed in
a more advanced stage of society, the power to devote yourself
to pursuits agreeable to your taste&mdash;did you not regret these?"</p>

<p>"Permit me to put your question into plainer language,"
interposed Mr. Grahame. "Mr. Danforth would ask, Mary,
whether you would not prefer to live where you would not be
compelled to degrade your mind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, I protest against the degradation," exclaimed Mr.
Danforth.</p>

<p>"To degrade your mind," pursued Mr. Grahame, answering
the interruption only by a smile, "by exercising it on such
homely things as brewing coffee and baking cakes, or to soil
your fair hands with brooms and dusters."</p>

<p>"For the soil of the hands we have sparkling rills, and for
the degradation of the mind, I, like Mr. Danforth, protest
against it."</p>

<p>"But how can you make your protest good?"</p>

<p>"You have taught me that there is no degradation in labor,
pursued for fair and right ends, and that where the end is noble,
the labor becomes ennobling."</p>

<p>"But what noble ends can be alleged for the drudgery of
domestic life? I am translating your looks into language,"
said Mr. Grahame, turning playfully to his guest; "correct me
if I do not read them rightly."</p>

<p>"If I say you do, I fear Miss Grahame will think them very
impertinent looks."</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_112' id='Page_112' title='112'>&nbsp;</a>"I shall not complain of them while I can reply to them so
easily," said Mary gayly. "He who knows how much a well-ordered
household contributes to the cultivation of domestic
virtues and family affections, will not think a woman degraded
who sacrifices somewhat of her tastes and pleasures to the deeper
happiness of procuring such advantages for those she loves."</p>

<p>"But is not that state of society preferable, in which,
without her personal interference, by the employment of those
who have no higher tastes, she may accomplish the same
object?"</p>

<p>"That question proves that you do not, like my father,
desire to see the working and the thinking classes united.
You seem to propose that the first shall ever remain our hewers
of wood and drawers of water."</p>

<p>"Is it not a fact that there have been, are, and always will
be those in the world who are fitted for no other position?"</p>

<p>"That there are and always have been such persons, I
acknowledge; but when labor ceases to be degrading, because
it is partaken by all, may we not hope that new aspirations will
be awakened in the laborer&mdash;that he will elevate himself in the
scale of being when he feels elevation possible?"</p>

<p>Mary Grahame spoke with generous enthusiasm, yet with
a modest gentleness which made Horace Danforth desire to
continue the argument.</p>

<p>"Admitting all this," he said, "it does not answer my
question, which was, whether you did not prefer that state of
society in which you were able to avail yourself of the services
of such a class?"</p>

<p>"There are moments, doubtless, when indolence would
plead for such self-indulgence; but I should be mortified,
indeed, where this the prevailing temper of my mind."</p>

<p>"Pardon me if I say that I do not see how it can be otherwise&mdash;how
a lady of Miss Grahame's refinement and taste can<a class='page' name ='Page_113' id='Page_113' title='113'>&nbsp;</a>
be pleased with the employments, for instance, to which Mr.
Grahame just now referred."</p>

<p>"Not pleased with them in themselves, but she may accept
them, may she not, as a necessary part of a great object to
which she has devoted herself?"</p>

<p>"And this object?&mdash;but, forgive me. The interest you
have awakened in the subject, and your kindness in answering
my questions, make me an encroacher, I fear," he added, as he
marked the heightened color with which Mary glanced at her
father as he paused for her answer.</p>

<p>"Not at all; but I speak in presence of my master, and will
refer you to him," she replied, with another smiling glance at
her father.</p>

<p>"You see," said Mr. Grahame, "that even in these wilds,
'the world's dread laugh' retains its power. Mary, I see, is
afraid of being called a female Quixote, and even I find myself
disposed to win you to some interest in my object, before I
avow it. This I think I can best do by a sketch of the circumstances
which led to its adoption. I will give you such a
sketch, therefore, if you will promise to acquit me of egotism
in doing so."</p>

<p>"That I will readily do. I shall be delighted to hear it."</p>

<p>"You shall have it, but not now; for I see, by certain
cabalistic signs, known only to the initiated, that Mary is about
to leave us for some of those same degrading employments, and
if you will take a ride with me, I will relieve you from all danger
of contact with them, and will, at the same time, show you
something of our neighborhood."</p>

<p>The proposal was of course accepted. The ride embraced a
circuit of ten miles, in which they passed only two houses. The
first of these was built with an apparent regard to convenience
and comfort, and even some effort at adornment, as manifested
in the climbing plants with which the windows were draperied,<a class='page' name ='Page_114' id='Page_114' title='114'>&nbsp;</a>
and the flowers which adorned the little court in front. Mr.
Grahame stopped before the gateway of this court, and a woman
of coarse, rough exterior, though scrupulously clean, came out
to speak to him, and to urge his alighting and entering the
house with his friend. This Mr. Grahame declined; he had
stopped only to inquire after a sick child, and to express a hope
that her husband's hay had turned out well.</p>

<p>"Dreadful fine," was her reply to the last. "I'm sure we
be much obleeged to you for the seed, and for tellin' Jim how
to plant it He never had sich hay before."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it. Where is Lucy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she's off to school. Tell Miss Mary she's gittin' to be
'most as grand a reader as she be. And yet the child's willin'
enough to work, for all."</p>

<p>As the gentlemen rode on, after this interview, Mr. Grahame
said, "That last speech expressed one of the greatest difficulties
against which we had to contend in our efforts to induce our
neighbors to give to their children some of the advantages of
education. They were afraid 'larnin' would make them lazy.'
They were of your opinion, that the thinker and the worker
must remain of different classes."</p>

<p>"I was much surprised to hear that woman speak of a
school. I should not think the teacher could find his situation
very profitable."</p>

<p>"He is one who has regard to a higher reward than any
earthly one. He is a self-denying Christian missionary, whom
I induced to settle in our neighborhood. He preaches on the
Sabbath, in a little church about two miles from my house, to
a congregation of about twenty adults, and twice that number
of children; and during the week, he keeps a school which is
well attended in the summer. Some of his earlier pupils are
already showing, by their more useful and more happy lives,
the importance of the schoolmaster's work in the elevation of a
people."</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_115' id='Page_115' title='115'>&nbsp;</a>The next dwelling they approached was very small and
mean-looking. It seemed to Horace Danforth to contain only
one apartment, warmed by an ill-constructed clay chimney, and
lighted by one small, square window. That window, however,
was not only sashed and glazed, but shaded by a plain muslin
curtain.</p>

<p>"Here," said Mr. Grahame, "lives one of those pupils of
whom I spoke just now. He has commenced life with nothing
but the plot of ground you see, and having a wife to support,
he must work hard, yet already he is aiming at something
more than the supply of merely physical wants; and I doubt
not he will, should he live long enough, become the intelligent
and wealthy father of a well-educated family."</p>

<p>They were approaching the house as Mr. Grahame spoke.
Near it was a small field, in which a man was hoeing.</p>

<p>"How is your wife, Martin?" asked Mr. Grahame.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, sir, she is quite smart. She's been getting
better ever since the night Miss Mary sat up with her last.
We say she always brings good luck."</p>

<p>"And how are your potatoes?"</p>

<p>"How could they help but be good, sir, with such grand
seed as you gave me? Tell Miss Mary, if you please, sir, that
the rose-tree is growing finely, and that as soon as I can get
time to put up the fence, Sally is to have the flower-garden she
talked about."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it, Martin; if you are brisk you may
have some flowers yet before frost. I will bring you some
seeds the next time I come."</p>

<p>"Do you procure your seeds from the East, or is it the
result of your superior cultivation, that you are able thus to
supply your neighbors?" asked Horace Danforth of Mr.
Grahame, as they rode on.</p>

<p>"The potatoes were from my own field, raised from the<a class='page' name ='Page_116' id='Page_116' title='116'>&nbsp;</a>
seed two years ago. The grass and flower seeds were from my
agent at the East. These little favors win for my daughter
and myself considerable influence over our neighbors, and thus
facilitate our attainment of the object for which we have pitched
our tent in the wilderness, and accepted those labors which you
justly regard as distasteful in themselves."</p>

<p>The return home of Mr. Grahame and his visitor, their
dinner and afternoon engagements, offer nothing worthy of our
notice. It was not till the labors of the day had been concluded,
and the little party were gathered again before a
cheerful fire in the parlor, that the subject of the morning's
conversation was resumed. As Mary entered from the supper-room,
bringing with her a little basket of needle-work, Horace
Danforth asked if he might not now hope to receive the
promised sketch.</p>

<p>"I will give it you with pleasure when I have had my
evening song from Mary," said Mr. Grahame.</p>

<p>Opening the piano for his young hostess, Horace Danforth
stood beside her as she sang, but he forgot to turn the leaves
of the music before her as he listened once again to a rich and
cultivated voice, accompanied by a fine instrument, touched by
a skilful hand. As the sweet and well-remembered strains fell
on his ear, he closed his eyes and gave the reins to fancy. The
loved and lost gathered around him, and it was with a strange,
dream-like feeling that, as the sweet sound ceased, and Mary
arose from the piano, he opened his eyes and looked upon the
rough walls and simple furniture of his present abode.</p>

<p>"It is now nearly nineteen years," began Mr. Grahame,
when his daughter and guest had resumed their seats near him,
"since, crushed in spirit, I turned from the grave in which I
had laid my chief earthly blessing, to wander 'any where, any
where out of that world' which had a few weeks before been
bright and joyous to me, but which I was now ready to<a class='page' name ='Page_117' id='Page_117' title='117'>&nbsp;</a>
pronounce a desolate waste. The desire to avoid society made
me turn westward, and nearly one hundred miles east of our
present residence I found myself in the midst of a people
without churches, without schools, rude in appearance and in
manners. Absorbed in the destruction of my own selfish
happiness, I might have passed from among them without
knowing that disease was adding its pangs to those inflicted by
want, ignorance, and superstition, had not a mother in the agony
of parting from her first-born, looking hither and thither for
help, turned her eyes entreatingly upon the stranger. I had
once studied medicine, though regarding the profession, as our
young men too often do, merely as a means of personal aggrandizement,
and having received just at the completion of my
studies an accession of fortune, which removed all pecuniary
necessity to exertion on my part, I had never practised it, nor
indeed obtained the diploma necessary to its practice. Now,
however, I endeavored to make myself master of the peculiar
features of the epidemic under which the child was suffering,
and with the aid of a small store of medicines which my
good sister had insisted on my taking with me, and a rigid
enforcement of some of the simplest rules of diet and regimen, I
had the happiness of seeing the child in a few days out of danger,
and of receiving the mother's rapturous thanks. That moment,
gave me the first gleam of happiness I had known for months,
and disposed me to listen to the entreaties of the poor creatures
who came from far and near to entreat the aid of the Doctor,
as they persisted in calling me, notwithstanding my repeated
assurances that I had no right to the title. I spent weeks in
that neighborhood, and there I was born to a new life. Till
that time I had lived to myself, and when that in which I had
centered my earthly joy was snatched from me by death, I
had felt that life had nothing left for me; but now I saw that
while there were sentient beings in the universe to serve, and a<a class='page' name ='Page_118' id='Page_118' title='118'>&nbsp;</a>
glorious and ever blessed Father presiding over that universe
and smiling on such service, life could not be divested of joy.
Under the influence of such views my plans for the future were
formed, nor have I ever seen reason to change or to regret them.
Every where the Christian religion teaches the same precepts,
but not every where is it equally easy to see the way in which
those precepts may be obeyed; every where it is true, as a distinguished
writer of your own land has said, 'Blessed is the
man who has found his work&mdash;let him seek no other blessedness;'
but not every where is it equally easy to see where our
work lies. Here, in America, the partition-walls which stand
elsewhere as a remnant of the old feudalism, have been broken
down; every man is irresistibly pressed into contact with his
neighbors&mdash;he cannot shut his eyes to their wants&mdash;he cannot
stop his ears against their cries. In America, too, every man,
as I have already said, must be a worker&mdash;or, if he live an idler,
it must be on that which his father gained by the sweat of his
brow, and he leaves his children to enslaving toil, or more enslaving
dependence. Here the man of pleasure, the idler of
either sex, is a foreign exotic which finds no nourishment in
our soil, no shelter from our institutions&mdash;which is out of
harmony with our social life, and must ever be marked by the
innate vulgarity of unsustained pretension. Therefore it is
comparatively easy for us to hold out the hand of love to our
brethren, sinking and suffering at our very side, and to teach
them that there is no natural inalienable connection between
labor and coarseness, ignorance and servility; that man, though
compelled to win his bread by the sweat of his brow, may still
enjoy all those graceful amenities of which woman was the type
in Paradise and is the promoter here; that the light of knowledge
and the divine light of faith may still cheer him in his
pursuits and guide him to his rest. It seems to me that to bring
out these principles fairly to the world's perception, is the mission<a class='page' name ='Page_119' id='Page_119' title='119'>&nbsp;</a>
to which America has been especially appointed&mdash;is that for
which Americans should live; and to this I have accordingly
devoted myself. For this I purchased my present property&mdash;for
this I determined, while allowing myself and my daughter
all the comforts of life, to dispense with many of those luxuries
to which my fortune might have seemed to entitle us, lest I
should separate myself too far from those I would aid. Here I
have spent seventeen years of life, happy in my work, and
happier in the conviction that it has not been in vain."</p>

<p>As Mr. Grahame paused, Horace Danforth turned to Mary
Grahame. Her eyes were fixed upon him. They seemed to
challenge his admiration for her father, in whose hand her own
was clasped, as though she would thus intimate the perfect accordance
of her feelings with his.</p>

<p>"And this, then," he said to her, "is your object?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"An object to which you were devoted by your father in
your infancy?"</p>

<p>"And which I have since adopted on my own intelligent
conviction," said Mary, earnestly, losing all timidity in a glow
of that generous enthusiasm which sits so gracefully on a gentle
woman.</p>

<p>There was silence in the little circle&mdash;silence with all; with
one, thought was rapidly passing down the long vista of the
past, and pointing the awakened mind to the fact that elsewhere
than in America was there ignorance to be enlightened
and want to be relieved&mdash;that not here only did Christianity
teach that man should live not unto himself alone, and that he
should love his neighbor as himself.</p>

<p>The thoughts and feelings aroused on that evening colored
the whole future destiny of Horace Danforth. Ere another day
had passed, he had confided to his host so much of his history
as proved him to be an aimless and almost unconnected wan<a class='page' name ='Page_120' id='Page_120' title='120'>&nbsp;</a>derer
on the earth, with a prospect of a fortune which, unequal
to the demands of a man of fashion in England, would give to
a <i>worker</i> in America great influence for good or for evil&mdash;as the
personal property of Sir Thomas Maitland could not, as Horace
Danforth was well aware, be valued at less than 50,000 dollars.
With that rapid decision which had ever marked his movements,
the young Englishman determined to purchase land in
the neighborhood of Mr. Grahame, there to rear his future hope,
and to devote his life to the like noble purposes. The land
was purchased, the site for the house was selected and marked
out&mdash;but the house was never built&mdash;for ere that had been
accomplished Horace Danforth discovered that the companionship
of a cultivated woman was essential to his views of "Life
in America," and that Mary Grahame was exactly the embodiment
of that youthful vision which he had sought in vain elsewhere;
for she united the delicacy and refined grace, with the
intelligent mind, the active affections and energetic will, which
were necessary at once to please his fancy and satisfy his heart
Mary Grahame could not consent to leave her father to a lonely
home, but yet she could not deny that it would be a sad home
to her if deprived of the society of him whose intelligent and
varied converse and manly tenderness had lately formed the
chief charm of her existence. There was only one way of
reconciling these conflicting claims. Horace Danforth must
live with Mr. Grahame; and so he did, having first obtained
that gentleman's permission to enlarge his house, and to furnish
it with some of those inventions by which art has so greatly
lightened domestic occupation, and which had been made familiar
to him by his life abroad.</p>

<p>Six months had been spent in this abode&mdash;six months of
an existence of joy and love, untroubled as it could be to those
who were yet dwellers upon earth&mdash;six months in which the
fastidious and world-wearied man learned the secret of true<a class='page' name ='Page_121' id='Page_121' title='121'>&nbsp;</a>
peace in a life devoted to useful and benevolent objects&mdash;when
a most unexpected visitor arrived in the person of Sir Edward
Maitland&mdash;no, not Sir Edward. He came to announce that to
this title he had no right. That he had remained himself, and
suffered his cousin to remain so long in ignorance on this point,
had been the result of no want of effort to arrive at the truth,
still less of any lingering love of the honors forced upon him.
He had never assumed the title, nor suffered the secret of his
supposed change of circumstances to be known beyond himself
and the lawyer to whom his cousin Horace had revealed it.
This lawyer, it may be remembered, had lately succeeded in
the care of the Maitland estate to an uncle, who had been
compelled by the infirmities of advancing age to retire from
business. The old man was absent from England when Horace
Danforth left it, and it was not till his return that full satisfaction
on the subject had been obtained, as it was judged unwise
by Mr. Decker to awaken public attention by investigations
which his uncle's return would probably render unnecessary.
When he did return, and the subject was cautiously unfolded
to him, he spent many minutes in <i>pishing</i> and <i>pshawing</i> at the
folly and impetuosity of young Baronets, who, knowing nothing
of the tenure on which they hold their estates, cannot at
least wait till they consult wiser people before they throw them
away. The entail of nearly two centuries ago had, it seems,
been set aside in little more than one, by an improvident father
and son, who had in fact greatly diminished the very fine property
so entailed, though most of it had been since recovered by
the care of their successors. The intelligence thus conveyed to
him who was now once more Sir Horace Danforth Maitland,
was of mingled sweet and bitter. He could not be insensible
to the joy of returning to the home of his childhood and the
people among whom he had grown to manhood, yet neither
could he leave, without tender regrets, that in which he had<a class='page' name ='Page_122' id='Page_122' title='122'>&nbsp;</a>
first learned to love, and to live a true, a noble, and a happy
life.</p>

<p>When Mary was first saluted as Lady Maitland by Edward,
she turned a glance of inquiry upon her husband, and then
upon her father, for both were present by previous arrangement;
and as she read a confirmation of the fact in their smiling faces,
the color faded from hers, and after a moment's vain effort to
contend against her painful emotion, she burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Your father has promised to spend his life with us, dearest,"
said Sir Horace Maitland, as he threw his arm around
her and drew her to his side.</p>

<p>"But this dear home," sobbed Mary; "this people, for whom
and with whom we have lived so happily."</p>

<p>"All that made this home dear, my daughter, you will take
with you to another home."</p>

<p>"And there, too," interposed Sir Horace, "my Mary will
find a people to enlighten and to bless, over whom her influence
will be unbounded, and to whom she will prove an angel of
consolation."</p>

<p>"And can you carry your American life to your English
home?" she asked of her husband, smiling through her tears.</p>

<p>"As much of it as is independent of outward circumstances,
Mary&mdash;its spirit, its aims; for they belong to a Christian life,
and that I hope, by God's blessing, to live henceforth, wherever
I may be."</p>

<p>"And what will become of all our projected improvements
here?" she inquired of her father.</p>

<p>"I shall not leave this place myself, Mary, till I can find
some one like-minded, who will take our place and do our
work. To such a man I will sell the property on such terms as
he can afford, or if he cannot buy, he shall farm it for me."</p>

<p>This last was the arrangement made with one whom Mr.
Grahame had known in early life, and who had always been<a class='page' name ='Page_123' id='Page_123' title='123'>&nbsp;</a>
distinguished by true Christian uprightness and benevolence
The terms offered by Mr. Grahame to this gentleman were such,
that the conscientious and excellent agent became in a few
years the proprietor and under his fostering care, all those
plans for the intellectual and moral improvement of the neighborhood
which had been so happily commenced, were matured
and perfected.</p>

<p>It was nearly a year after the departure of his children before
Mr. Grahame was able to join them at Maitland Park.
With his arrival Mary felt that her cup of joy was full. It had
been with a trembling heart that she assumed the brilliant position
to which Providence had conducted her; not that she
feared the judgment of man: her fear had been lest in the midst
of abundance she should forget the hand that fed her&mdash;lest
amidst the fascinations of an intellectual and polished society,
she should forget the thick darkness which covered so many
immortal minds around her. But already she had cast aside
this unworthy fear, unworthy of Him in whom is the Christian's
strength.</p>

<p>The early dream of the Proprietor of Maitland Park is fulfilled.
The softening and refining presence of woman diffuses
a new charm over its social life, and while his Mary is to his
tenantry what he himself predicted, an angel of consolation,
she is to him a faithful co-worker in all that may advance the
reign of peace and righteousness, of intelligence and joy,
throughout the world.</p>

<p>A Sabbath in the country, with a Sabbath quiet in the air,
and a cheerful sunlight beaming like the smile of Heaven on
the earth&mdash;how beautiful it is! Donaldson Manor is only a
short walk from the church whose white spire gleams up amidst
the dark grove of pines on our left; at least, it is only a short
walk in summer, when we can approach it through the flowery
lanes which separate Col. Donaldson's fields from those of his
next neighbor, Mr. Manly. Now, however, the walk is impracticable,
and all the sleighs were yesterday morning in requisition,
to transport the family and their visitors to their place of
worship. I was a little afraid that the merry music of the sleigh-bells
and the rapid drive through the clear air might make our
young people's blood dance too briskly&mdash;that they would be
unable to preserve that sobriety of manner becoming those who
are about professedly to engage in the worship of Him who
inhabiteth Eternity. I was gratified, however, to perceive that
they all had good feeling or good taste enough to preserve,
throughout their drive and the services which followed it, a
quiet and reverent demeanor. It may seem strange to some,
that I should characterize this as a possible effect of "good
taste;" but in my opinion, he who does not pay the tribute at
least of outward respect to this holy day, is incapable not only
of that high, spiritual communion which brings man near to
his Creator, but of that tender sympathy which binds him to<a class='page' name ='Page_125' id='Page_125' title='125'>&nbsp;</a>
his fellow-creatures, or even of that poetic taste which would
place his soul in harmony with external nature. Let it not be
thought that I would have this day of blessing to the world regarded
with a cynical severity, or that the quietness and the
reverence of which I speak are at all akin to sadness. Were
not cheerfulness, in my opinion, a part of godliness, I should
say of it as some one has said of cleanliness, that it is next to
godliness. Like my favorite, Mrs. Elizabeth Barrett Browning,</p>

<p>But cheerfulness, so far from being incompatible with, seems to
me inseparable from that true worship which is the best source
of the Sabbath seriousness I am advocating.</p>

<p>The remarks of the preacher were quite in unison with
these thoughts, and pleased me so much that, were it admissible,
I should be delighted to dignify my pages with them. By a
few vivid touches, in language simple, yet beautiful, he sketched
for us the first Sabbath amidst the living springs and fadeless
bloom and verdant shades of Paradise, when sinless man communed
with his Maker and his Father, not through the poor
symbols of a ceremonial worship, but face to face, as a man
talketh with his friend. But all I would say of the Sabbath
has been said a thousand times better than I could say it, by
good George Herbert, whose words I am sure I need not apologize
for introducing here.</p>

<p>Mr. Arlington is a gem of the first water. He reveals every
day some new trait of interest or agreeableness. I saw immediately
that he was a man of fine taste; I have since learned
to respect him as a man of enlarged intellect and earnest feeling;
and now I am just beginning to discover that he is master
of all those <i>agr&eacute;mens</i> which constitute the charm of general
society, and that he might become the "glass of fashion," if he
had not a mind elevated too far above such a petty ambition.
This last observation has been called forth by mere trifles,
yet trifles so prettily shown, with such ease and grace, as to
justify the conclusion. He is apt at illustration and application,
and has a fine memory, stored brimfull of entertaining anecdotes,
snatches of poetry, and those thousand nothings which
tell for so much in society, and which it is so pleasant to find
combined with much else that is valuable. A few evenings
since, he kept Annie and me in the library, with his agreeable
chat, till so late an hour, that Col. Donaldson, who is the least
bit of a martinet in his own family, gave some very intelligible
hints to us the next morning, at breakfast, on the value of early
hours. With a readiness and grace which I never saw surpassed,
Mr. Arlington turned to us with the exquisite apology of the
poet for a like fault,</p>

<p>As the others were engaged in very earnest conversation at
the time, and I was reading, he probably expected to be heard
only by her to whom he addressed himself; but a little romance,
such as that of Annie and Mr. Arlington, acted before
me, interests me far more than any book, and I brought a
bright blush to Annie's cheek and a conscious smile to his lip,
by asking, "Where did you find those very apposite lines? I
do not remember to have seen them."</p>

<p>"Probably not, as they have never been published. They
were addressed by Anthony Bleecker, of New-York, to a belle
of his day, and the lady for whose sake, it is whispered, he
lived and died a bachelor."</p>

<p>Our colloquy was here interrupted by Robert Dudley, who
wanted to know if we were to have no story this evening.
Robert was a great lover of stories. "Ask Mr. Arlington,
Robert," said I, "I have given three stories to his one already."</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_132' id='Page_132' title='132'>&nbsp;</a>"Aunt Nancy," said Mr. Arlington, who had already begun
to give me the affectionate cognomen by which I was always
addressed at Donaldson Manor, "Aunt Nancy has stories without
number, written and ready for demand, but my portfolio
furnishes only rude pencilings, or at best a crayon sketch."</p>

<p>"Will you show them to us, Mr. Arlington?" asked the persevering
Robert, who stood beside him, portfolio in hand.
"May I draw one out, as Aunt Annie did the other evening;
and will you tell us about it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Arlington, with good-humored playfulness, consented,
and Robert drew from the portfolio one of his drawings, representing
a fisherman's family.</p>

<p>"That man," said I, as I looked at the honest face of the rude,
weather-beaten fisherman, "looks as though he had passed
through adventurous scenes, and might have many a history
to tell."</p>

<p>"He did not tell his histories to me," said Mr. Arlington.
"I know nothing more of them than that paper reveals. It
seemed to me that the woman and child were visiting, for the
first time, the ocean, whose booming sound was to the fisherman
as the voice of home. He was probably introducing them
to its wonders&mdash;revealing to them the mysteries which awaken
the superstition of the vulgar and the poetry of the cultivated
imagination. He has given her, you may observe, a sea-shell,
and she is listening for the first time to its low, strange music."</p>

<p>"And is that all?" asked Robert, when Mr. Arlington
ceased speaking.</p>

<p>"All I know, Robert," he answered, with a smile at the
boy's earnestness.</p>

<p>"But did you never go fishing yourself, Mr. Arlington?"</p>

<p>"Not often, Robert; I like more active sports better&mdash;hunting&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! do tell us about your hunting, Mr. Arlington; you<a class='page' name ='Page_133' id='Page_133' title='133'>&nbsp;</a>
must have had some adventures in hunting in those great
Western forests I have heard you speak of."</p>

<p>"The greatest adventure I ever had, Robert," said Mr.
Arlington, "was in an <i>Eastern</i> forest, and when I was the
<i>hunted</i>, not the <i>hunter</i>."</p>

<p>"Indians, Mr. Arlington&mdash;were they Indians that hunted
you?"</p>

<p>"No, Robert; my hunters were wolves."</p>

<p>"Oh! pray tell us about it, Mr. Arlington, will you not?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, with the ladies' permission."</p>

<p>The ladies' permission was soon obtained, and our little
party listened with the deepest interest to the thrilling recital
which I have called</p>

<p>During the winter of 1844, being engaged in the northern
part of Maine, I had much leisure to devote to the wild sports
of a new country. To none of these was I more passionately
addicted than to skating. The deep and sequestered lakes of
this State, frozen by the intense cold of a northern winter, present
a wide field to the lovers of this pastime. Often would I
bind on my skates, and glide away up the glittering river, and
wind each mazy streamlet that flowed beneath its fetters on towards
the parent ocean, forgetting all the while time and distance
in the luxurious sense of the gliding motion&mdash;thinking of
nothing in the easy flight, but rather dreaming, as I looked
through the transparent ice at the long weeds and cresses that
nodded in the current beneath, and seemed wrestling with the
waves to let them go; or I would follow on the track of some<a class='page' name ='Page_134' id='Page_134' title='134'>&nbsp;</a>
fox or otter, and run my skate along the mark he had left with his
dragging tail until the trail would enter the woods. Sometimes
these excursions were made by moonlight, and it was on one of
these occasions that I had a rencontre, which even now, with
kind faces around me, I cannot recall without a nervous looking-over-my-shoulder
feeling.</p>

<p>I had left my friend's house one evening just before dusk,
with the intention of skating a short distance up the noble Kennebec,
which glided directly before the door. The night was
beautifully clear. A peerless moon rode through an occasional
fleecy cloud, and stars twinkled from the sky and from every
frost-covered tree in millions. Your mind would wonder at the
light that came glinting from ice, and snow-wreath, and incrusted
branches, as the eye followed for miles the broad gleam
of the Kennebec, that like a jewelled zone swept between the
mighty forests on its banks. And yet all was still. The cold
seemed to have frozen tree, and air, and water, and every living
thing that moved. Even the ringing of my skates on the ice
echoed back from the Moccason Hill with a startling clearness,
and the crackle of the ice as I passed over it in my course
seemed to follow the tide of the river with lightning speed.</p>

<p>I had gone up the river nearly two miles when, coming to
a little stream which empties into the larger, I turned in to explore
its course. Fir and hemlock of a century's growth met
overhead, and formed an archway radiant with frost-work. All
was dark within, but I was young and fearless, and as I peered
into an unbroken forest that reared itself on the borders of the
stream, I laughed with very joyousness: my wild hurrah rang
through the silent woods, and I stood listening to the echo that
reverberated again and again, until all was hushed. I thought
how often the Indian hunter had concealed himself behind these
very trees&mdash;how often his arrow had pierced the deer by this
very stream, and his wild halloo had here rung for his victory.<a class='page' name ='Page_135' id='Page_135' title='135'>&nbsp;</a>
And then, turning from fancy to reality, I watched a couple of
white owls, that sat in their hooded state, with ruffled pantalettes
and long ear-tabs, debating in silent conclave the affairs
of their frozen realm, and was wondering if they, "for all their
feathers, were a-cold," when suddenly a sound arose&mdash;it seemed
to me to come from beneath the ice; it sounded low and tremulous
at first, until it ended in one wild yell. I was appalled.
Never before had such a noise met my ears. I thought it more
than mortal&mdash;so fierce, and amidst such an unbroken solitude,
it seemed as though a fiend had blown a blast from an infernal
trumpet. Presently I heard the twigs on shore snap, as though
from the tread of some brute animal, and the blood rushed
back to my forehead with a bound that made my skin burn,
and I felt relieved that I had to contend with things earthly,
and not of spiritual nature&mdash;my energies returned, and I looked
around me for some means of escape. The moon shone through
the opening at the mouth of the creek by which I had entered
the forest, and considering this the best channel of escape, I
darted towards it like an arrow. 'Twas scarcely a hundred
yards distant, and the swallow could hardly excel my desperate
flight; yet, as I turned my head to the shore, I could see two
dark objects dashing through the underbrush at a pace nearly
double in speed to my own. By this rapidity, and the short
yells which they occasionally gave, I knew at once that these
were the much dreaded gray wolf.</p>

<p>I had never met with these animals, but from the description
given of them I had very little pleasure in making their
acquaintance. Their untameable fierceness, and the untiring
strength which seems part of their nature, render them objects
of dread to every benighted traveller.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With their long gallop, which can tire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deer-hound's haste, the hunter's fire,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_136' id='Page_136' title='136'>&nbsp;</a>they pursue their prey&mdash;never straying from the track of their
victim&mdash;and as the wearied hunter thinks he has at last outstripped
them, he finds that they but waited for the evening to
seize their prey, and falls a prize to the tireless pursuers.</p>

<p>The bushes that skirted the shore flew past with the velocity
of lightning as I dashed on in my flight to pass the narrow
opening. The outlet was nearly gained; one second more and
I should be comparatively safe, when the fierce brutes appeared
on the bank directly above me, which here rose to the height of
ten feet. There was no time for thought, so I bent my head
and dashed madly forward. The wolves sprang, but miscalculating
my speed, sprang behind, while their intended prey
glided out upon the river.</p>

<p>Nature turned me towards home. The light flakes of snow
spun from the iron of my skates, and I was some distance from
my pursuers, when their fierce howl told me I was still their
fugitive. I did not look back, I did not feel afraid, or sorry, or
glad; one thought of home, of the bright faces awaiting my
return, of their tears if they never should see me, and then every
energy of body and mind was exerted for escape. I was perfectly
at home on the ice. Many were the days that I had
spent on my good skates, never thinking that at one time they
would be my only means of safety. Every half minute an alternate
yelp from my ferocious followers made me only too
certain that they were in close pursuit. Nearer and nearer they
came; I heard their feet pattering on the ice nearer still, until
I could feel their breath and hear their snuffing scent. Every
nerve and muscle in my frame were stretched to the utmost
tension.</p>

<p>The trees along the shore seemed to dance in the uncertain
light, and my brain turned with my own breathless speed, yet
still they seemed to hiss forth their breath with a sound truly
horrible, when an involuntary motion on my part turned me out<a class='page' name ='Page_137' id='Page_137' title='137'>&nbsp;</a>
of my course. The wolves close behind, unable to stop, and
as unable to turn on the smooth ice, slipped and fell, still going
on far ahead; their tongues were lolling out, their white tusks
glaring from their bloody mouths, their dark, shaggy breasts
were fleeced with foam, and as they passed me their eyes
glared, and they howled with fury. The thought flashed on
my mind, that by this means I could avoid them, viz., by turning
aside whenever they came too near; for they, by the formation
of their feet, are unable to run on ice except on a straight
line.</p>

<p>I immediately acted upon this plan. The wolves, having
regained their feet, sprang directly towards me. The race was
renewed for twenty yards up the stream; they were already
close on my back, when I glided round and dashed directly
past my pursuers. A wild yell greeted my evolution, and the
wolves, slipping upon their haunches, sailed onward, presenting
a perfect picture of helplessness and baffled rage. Thus I gained
nearly a hundred yards at each turning. This was repeated
two or three times, every moment the animals getting more
excited and baffled.</p>

<p>At one time, by delaying my turning too long, my sanguinary
antagonists came so near, that they threw the white
foam over my dress as they sprang to seize me, and their teeth
clashed together, like the spring of a fox-trap. Had my skates
failed for one instant, had I tripped on a stick, or caught my
foot in a fissure in the ice, the story I am now telling would
never have been told. I thought all the chances over; I knew
where they would first take hold of me if I fell; I thought how
long it would be before I died, and then there would be a
search for the body that would already have its tomb;&mdash;for
oh! how fast man's mind traces out all the dread colors of
Death's picture, only those who have been near the grim original
can tell.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_138' id='Page_138' title='138'>&nbsp;</a>But soon I came opposite the house, and my hounds&mdash;I
knew their deep voices&mdash;roused by the noise, bayed furiously
from the kennels. I heard their chains rattle; how I wished
they would break them! and then I should have protectors
that would be peers to the fiercest denizens of the forest. The
wolves, taking the hint conveyed by the dogs, stopped in their
mad career, and after a moment's consideration, turned and fled.
I watched them until their dusky forms disappeared over a
neighboring hill. Then, taking off my skates, wended my way
to the house, with feelings which may be better imagined than
described.</p>

<p>But even yet, I never see a broad sheet of ice in the moonshine,
without thinking of that snuffling breath and those fearful
things that followed me so closely down the frozen Kennebec.</p>

<p>"What a noble forest!" cried Annie, as she gazed with rapturous
admiration on a noble specimen of the engraver's art&mdash;so
noble, indeed, that the absence of color seemed hardly to be
felt. It was a richly-wooded scene, with interesting figures
forming a procession in the centre and foreground of the landscape.

crooked branches, look as though they might have formed part
of the Druidical groves whose solemn mysteries inspired even
the arrogant Roman with awe. This picture, however, belongs
to a later period&mdash;that of the Crusades, perhaps, for here is a
procession in which appear figures in the long robe of the monk,
and I think I can discern a cross on that banner borne at their
head. But what, dear Aunt Nancy, could you possibly find in
our land of yesterday, to associate with such a scene?"</p>

<p>"Our people may be of yesterday, Annie, but our land bears
no marks of recent origin. The most arrogant boaster of the
Old World may feel himself humbled as he stands within the
shadow of our forests, and looks up to trees which we might
almost fancy to have waved over the heads of 'the patriarchs of
an infant world?'"</p>

<p>"And you have seen some such forests, and on the branches
of these old trees 'hangs a tale' which you will tell us. Is it
not so, Aunt Nancy?"</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_140' id='Page_140' title='140'>&nbsp;</a>"I have seen such a forest, and I have a sketch of certain
events occurring within its circle. The narrative was given
me by my friend, Mrs. H., who was acquainted with the parties.
You will find it in her handwriting in the compartment of my
desk from which you took the engraving."</p>

<p>Annie found the paper, and I saw a quiet smile pass around
as she read aloud its title. Mr. Arlington, at my request, took
the reader's place, and we spent our evening in listening to</p>

<p>It is an almost universal belief among those who have faith in
man's immortality, that when his spiritual nature has been
divested of its present veil&mdash;the bodily organization by which
it at pleasure reveals or conceals itself&mdash;it shall be manifested
to all at a glance in the unsullied beauty of holiness, or the
dark deformity of vice. Shall our vision extend further? Shall
we read the soul's past history? Shall we know the struggles
which have given strength to its powers? The fears which
have shadowed, and the hopes which have lighted, its earthly
path? Shall we learn the unspoken sacrifices which have been
laid on the altar of its affections or its duty? Shall we see
how a single generous impulse has shaped the whole course of
its being, and been as a heavenly flame, to which every selfish
desire and feeling have been committed in noiseless devotion?
If this be so, how many such records shall be furnished by the
life of woman? How often shall it be found, that from such a
flame has risen the light with which she has brightened the
existence of others!</p>

<p>Meeta Werner was the daughter of industrious, honest Germans,
who had emigrated to the western part of Pennsylvania
when she was a child of only seven years old. Only a quarter
of a mile from the spot on which Carl Werner had fixed his<a class='page' name ='Page_141' id='Page_141' title='141'>&nbsp;</a>
residence lived a brother German, Franz Rainer. Franz was a
widower, with one child, a son, named Ernest. He was a hard,
stern man, and the first smiles which had lighted the existence
of the young Ernest were caught from the sprightly Meeta and
her kind-hearted mother. The children became playfellows
and friends. It was a wild country in which they lived. A
very short walk from their own doors brought them into a forest
which seemed to their young imaginations endless; where
gigantic trees interlaced their branches, and with their green
foliage shut out the sun in summer, or in winter reflected it in
dazzling brightness, and a thousand gorgeous colors, from the
icicles which cased their leafless branches and pendent twigs.
There was not a footpath, a sunny hill or flowery dell, for miles
around their homes, which had not been trodden together by
Meeta Werner and Ernest Rainer before their acquaintance was
a year old. Now they would come home laden with wood-flowers,
and now they might be seen treading wearily back
from some distant spot, with baskets filled with blackberries,
or with the dark-blue whortleberries. There were no schools
in the neighborhood, but they had been taught by their
fathers to read and write their own language, and Ernest
afterwards acquired some knowledge of English from the
good pastor who had accompanied the emigrants from Germany,
and who acted as their interpreter when they required one.
Having access to few books, they seemed likely to grow up with
little more learning than might be gathered from their own observation
of the world around them; but when Ernest was
eighteen and Meeta fifteen years of age, circumstances occurred
which gave an entirely new coloring to their lives.</p>

<p>Franz Rainer had not always been so stern and hard as he
now seemed. He had married imprudently, in the world's acceptation
of that term; that is, he had made a portionless but
lovely girl his wife, and in doing so had incurred his father's
lasting displeasure. He had been banished from a home of<a class='page' name ='Page_142' id='Page_142' title='142'>&nbsp;</a>
plenty with a small sum, "to keep him from starving," he was
told. With that sum and a young delicate wife he sailed for
America, and found a home for himself and his boy, and a
grave for his wife, in the forests of Pennsylvania. Too proud
to seek a reconciliation with those who had cast him off, he had
held no communication with his own family after leaving Germany;
and it was not till Ernest was, as we have said, eighteen,
that the silence of his home was broken by what seemed
a voice from the past. After many hindrances and delays, and
passing through many hands for which it had not been intended,
a letter reached him from a merchant in Philadelphia, who
had been requested to institute a search for Franz by his only
brother. The old Rainer was dead, and the family estate had
descended to this brother, a scholar and a man of solitary habits.
Finding himself growing old in a lonely home, and retaining
some kindly memory of the brother in whose companionship
his childhood had been passed, he wished him to return to Germany,
and again dwell with them in the house of their fathers.
To this Franz would by no means consent. His nature was
cast in too stern a mould to re-knit at a word the ties which
had been so violently sundered. He consented, however, after
some correspondence with his brother, to send Ernest to Germany,
to be educated there; at least, to receive such an education
as could be gained in four years; for he insisted that at the
end of that time he should return to America, and remain there
while his father lived. "After my death, if he choose to return
to the home from which his father was banished, he may,"
wrote the still resentful Franz.</p>

<p>And how was this change in all the prospects of his life received
by the young Ernest and his companion Meeta? By him
with mingled feelings; regret, joy, fear, hope, by turns ruled
his soul. The regret was all for Meeta and her mother; they
were the sources of all his pleasant memories; and as he gazed<a class='page' name ='Page_143' id='Page_143' title='143'>&nbsp;</a>
upon Meeta's hitherto bright face, now clouded with sorrow,
and kissed from her cheek the first tears he had ever known
her to shed for herself, he was ready to give up all his fair prospects
abroad and live with her for ever. Meeta herself, however,
gave a new direction to his thoughts, by generously turning
from the subject of her grief in parting, to dwell on the idea
of the delight with which they would meet again, and especially
on her peculiar pleasure in seeing Ernest come back "riding
in a grand coach, with servants following him on horseback,
as she remembered to have seen in Germany, and knowing
enough to teach Parson Schmidt himself!" After listening to
such prophecies, Ernest no longer expressed any desire to remain
with Meeta; he contented himself, instead, with promising
to return as soon as he could, and with winning from her a
promise that, come when he might, she would be his wife.
This was not a new thought or a new word to either. They
could scarcely tell themselves when the idea had first arisen in
their minds that they would one day live together, and be what
Carl Werner and his wife were to each other. They had even
chosen a site for their house; and Ernest had more than once
of late expressed the opinion that they were old enough to inform
their parents of their intentions; but the more timid
Meeta objected. Now, however, she could refuse Ernest nothing,
and before the day of parting came they had made a <i>confidante</i>
of Meeta's mother, and from her the two fathers had learned the
desires of their children. Carl Werner heard the story with a
smile; but a denser shadow gathered on the dark brow of Franz.
For a moment something of his father's pride was in his heart;
but his own blighted life arose before him, and he said, "The boy
may do as he pleases. No man has a right to control another
on such a subject."</p>

<p>The sun had not yet risen, though its rays were gilding the
few light clouds that flecked the eastern sky, when Meeta and<a class='page' name ='Page_144' id='Page_144' title='144'>&nbsp;</a>
Ernest stood together beneath an old oak which had long been
their favorite "trysting-tree," to say those words and give and
receive those last looks which are among life's most sacred treasures.
Smiles and blushes mingled with tears on Meeta's cheek
as Ernest pressed her to his bosom, kissed her again and again,
and promised that his first letter from Germany should be addressed
to her, and that in exactly four years from that date he
would be again beneath that tree, to claim her promise to be
his for ever. The voice of Carl Werner, who was to accompany
Ernest the first stage of his journey, startled them in the
midst of their adieus; and bursting from the arms of her companion,
Meeta plunged deeper into the woods to escape her
father's eye. When Carl returned in the evening he handed
her a small parcel, saying, "There's some foolery that Ernest
bought for you, Meeta. Silly boy! I hope they'll teach him in
Germany to take better care of his money!"</p>

<p>The parcel contained a very plain locket, with one of
Ernest's dark curls inclosed in it. Plain as it was, it seemed to
Meeta, as it probably had seemed to Ernest, a magnificent present;
yet she valued more the few simple words written on the
paper which enveloped it: "For Meeta, my promised wife."
Four months passed away before Meeta heard again of her lover.
Then there came a letter to her, which was full of the great
cities through which Ernest had passed, the home to which he
had come, and the new life which was opening to him there.
In his descriptions his uncle seemed a very grand gentleman,
and his uncle's housekeeper almost as grand a lady. He told
of the new wardrobe which had been provided for him, the acquaintances
to whom he had been introduced, and the studies
he had commenced. And in all this Meeta saw but the first
step towards that grandeur which she had predicted for him,
and she rejoiced.</p>

<p>Four or five such letters were received by Meeta, each full<a class='page' name ='Page_145' id='Page_145' title='145'>&nbsp;</a>
of her lover himself; but they came at lengthening intervals,
and during the third year she received from him only messages
sent through his father, though every message still conveyed a
promise to write soon. The letters of Ernest showed that he
had made great advances in scholarship during his residence in
Germany, and to all but Meeta herself, and perhaps her mother,
they gave equal evidence that his heart was not with the home
or the friends he had left in America. But no shadow ever
passed over the transparent face of Meeta. Ernest was to her
still the frank, ardent, simple-hearted boy whom she had loved so
long and so truly. She was still his promised wife. Her quick
sensibility to all which touched him made her feel that there
was a change in the tone with which her father named him,
and an expression, half of anger, half of pity, on his face
when she alluded to him. It was an expression which gave her
pain, though she did not understand its meaning; and she
ceased to speak of Ernest, lest she should call it up; but his
locket lay next her heart, his letters were well-nigh worn away
with frequent reading, and no day passed in which she
did not visit the oak beneath which they had parted, and
beneath which she fondly believed they were to meet again.</p>

<p>During the fourth year of Ernest's absence his letters to his
father became more frequent, and sometimes inclosed a few lines
to Meeta. To both he expressed a strong desire to stay one
more year abroad, alleging that to interrupt his studies now
would be to render all his past labors unavailing. There was
hardly a struggle in Meeta's mind in yielding her almost
matured hopes to what seemed so reasonable a wish of Ernest;
but the elder Rainer was not so easily won to compliance.
Urgent representations from his brother as well as Ernest, did
at length, however, induce him to consent to the absence of his
son for another year.</p>

<p>This was an important year to Meeta. It brought her an<a class='page' name ='Page_146' id='Page_146' title='146'>&nbsp;</a>
acquaintance through whom her dormant intellect was aroused,
and her manners fitted for something more than the rude life
by which she had been hitherto surrounded. This was Mrs.
Schwartz, the wife of a young pastor, who had come to assist Mr.
Schmidt in those duties to which his advancing years rendered
him unequal. Mrs. Schwartz was a woman of no ordinary stamp.
Highly educated, with an intense enjoyment of every form of
beauty and grace, she saw something of them embellishing the
homeliest employments and most common life with which a
sentiment of duty was connected. Severe illness had confined
her to her bed for many weeks soon after her arrival, and
before she had been able to establish that perfect domestic economy,
which renders the daily and hourly inspection and
interference of the mistress of a mansion needless to the comfort
of its inmates. During this period, Meeta, whose sympathies
had been deeply interested in the stranger, nursed her, and
planned for her, and worked for her, until she made herself a
place in her heart among her life-friends. As Mrs. Schwartz
saw her moving around her with such busy kindness, the
thought often arose in her mind, "What can I do for her?"
This is a question we seldom ask ourselves of any one sincerely
without finding an answer to it.</p>

<p>We have said that Meeta had access to few books in early
life; we might have added that she had little opportunity of
hearing the conversation of persons more cultivated than herself.
Thus were the two great sources of intellectual development
sealed to her. She had a thoughtful, earnest mind. She loved
the beautiful world around her, and the <span class="smcap">Great Being</span> who
made and sustained that world. But if the contemplation of
these things awakened thoughts of a higher character than the
daily baking and brewing, milking and scrubbing in her father's
house, she had no language in which to clothe them, and vague
and undefined, they fleeted away like the morning mists, leaving<a class='page' name ='Page_147' id='Page_147' title='147'>&nbsp;</a>
no impress of their presence. Her acquaintance with Mrs.
Schwartz, and the conversation she sometimes heard between
her and her husband, gave to these shadows substance and
form, and awakened a new want in Meeta's soul&mdash;the want of
knowledge. As in all else, Ernest was present in this. He
would doubtless be intelligent, wise, like Mr. Schwartz, and how
could she be his companion? Something of these new experiences
in Meeta was divined by Mrs. Schwartz, and with a
true womanly tact she became her teacher without wounding
her self-love. The road to knowledge once opened to Meeta,
her advance on it was rapid. How could it be otherwise, when
every step was bringing her nearer to Earnest! The elevation
and refinement of mind which Meeta thus acquired impressed
themselves on her agreeable features. Her dark eyes became
bright with the soul's light, and her whole aspect so attractive,
that her old friends exclaimed, as they looked upon her, "How
handsome Meeta Werner grows, she who used to be so plain!"</p>

<p>After a time these superficial observers thought they had
found the cause of this change in Meeta's change of costume,
for a new sense of beauty had been awakened in her, under
whose guidance her dark hair was brought in soft silken braids
upon her cheeks, wound gracefully around her well-shaped head,
and sometimes ornamented with a ribbon or a cluster of wild
flowers: while her dresses where remodelled so as to resemble
less the fashion which her mother and her sister emigrants had
imported thirteen years before from Germany, and to give a
more natural air to her really fine figure.</p>

<p>"How wonderfully Meeta has improved," said Mr. Schwartz,
one evening to his wife, as he looked after the retreating form
of her friend.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I am truly rejoiced that she has so improved
before her lover returns to claim her."</p>

<p>"I wish he could have taken away with him such an im<a class='page' name ='Page_148' id='Page_148' title='148'>&nbsp;</a>pression
as our handsome and intelligent Meeta would now
make. He would have been much more likely to remain
constant to her. There must be a painful contrast between the
cultivated and graceful women he has known in Germany, and
his memory of his early love."</p>

<p>"Love is a great embellisher," said Mrs. Schwartz, with a
gay smile, and the conversation passed to more general topics.</p>

<p>The fifth year of Ernest's absence was gone, and still he
came not; but he was coming soon, at least so his father said,
though he did not show Meeta the letters on which he founded
his assertion. It was the first time he had withheld them; a
circumstance the more remarkable, because of late he seemed
to regard Meeta with greater affection and confidence than he
had ever done before. He now sought her society, and seemed
pleased and even proud of the connection to which he had at
first consented with some reluctance. It was very soon after
the reception of the letter from Ernest to which we have alluded,
that Franz Rainer's health began to fail, and that so rapidly,
that Meeta feared Ernest could not arrive in time to see him.
She was to the old man an angel of consolation, and he clung
to her as to his last hope. In pity to his lonely condition, her
own parents were willing to spare her for a time, and Meeta,
that she might take care of him by night as well as by day, had
removed to his house a week before Ernest's arrival. He came
not wholly unwarned of the sorrow that awaited him, for he had
found a letter from Meeta at the house of the merchant in
Philadelphia through whom he had corresponded with his
father, tenderly yet plainly revealing her fears, and urging him
to hurry homeward without delay. He travelled with little rest
or refreshment for two days and nights, and arrived late on the
third day at his father's house. It was a still summer evening,
and while the old man slept, Meeta sat near him in the only
parlor the house afforded, reading by a shaded night lamp.<a class='page' name ='Page_149' id='Page_149' title='149'>&nbsp;</a>
She heard the sound of carriage wheels, and paused to listen;
the sound ceased; a shadow darkened the moonlight which
had been streaming through an open window, and then Ernest,
the playfellow of her childhood, the lover of her youth, stood
before her; but how changed, how gloriously changed thought
Meeta, even in that hour of hurry and agitation. They gazed
on each other in silence for a moment, and then Meeta with a
bright smile, yet in a whisper, for even then she forgot not the
dying man, asked:</p>

<p>"Do you not know me, Ernest?"</p>

<p>"Meeta!" he ejaculated, as he took the hand she extended
to him, but dropping it almost immediately, he said anxiously:
"My father! he lives, Meeta?"</p>

<p>"He does, Ernest, and may live, I think <i>will</i> live, for many
days yet."</p>

<p>"Thank <span class="smcap">God</span>! then I shall see him again!"</p>

<p>The conversation had till now been in whispers, but Ernest
uttered his ejaculation of thankfulness aloud. There was a
movement in the old man's room, a sound, and Meeta glided
to his side.</p>

<p>"Who were you talking with, my daughter?" he murmured
feebly. For many days Franz Rainer had called Meeta
daughter, as though he found pleasure in recalling the tie between
them.</p>

<p>"With one who tells me Ernest has arrived, and will see
you soon," said Meeta.</p>

<p>"It is Ernest himself. I knew his voice: Ernest, my
son!" And the old man's tones were loud and strong, as
Meeta had heard them for days. In another moment, Ernest
was bending over his father, and they were gazing on each
other with a tenderness whose very existence they had not before
suspected. Tears were rolling down the face of the once
stern old man, as he pressed his son's hand again and again,<a class='page' name ='Page_150' id='Page_150' title='150'>&nbsp;</a>
and murmured blessings on him, and thanks to <span class="smcap">God</span> for his
safe return; and Ernest, as he marked the death-shadow on
his father's brow, felt that a tie was tearing away which had
been woven more intimately than he had supposed with his
heart's fibres. The weeping Meeta composed herself that she
might soothe them.</p>

<p>"Ernest, I cannot let you stay longer here; I am your
father's nurse."</p>

<p>"My nurse, my daughter, my all, Ernest; your gift to me,
my son, which, thank <span class="smcap">God</span>! you have come in time to receive
again from my hands. Take her to you, Ernest."</p>

<p>The old man held Meeta's hand clasped in his own towards
his son, and Ernest touched it, but so slightly and with a hand
so cold, that Meeta looked up in alarm. There was a beseeching
expression in the eyes that met hers; a look which she did
not understand, and yet on which she acted.</p>

<p>"Ernest," she said, "you are fatigued to death, and your
father has been too much agitated already. Go, I pray you,
for the present; I cannot leave your father, but you will
find coffee and biscuits by the kitchen fire, and there is a bed
prepared in your own room. Good-night; we shall meet
again to-morrow," she added with a smile to the old man.</p>

<p>Ernest gave her a more cordial glance and pressure of the
hand than she had yet received from him; told his father that
he would only snatch an hour's sleep and be with him again,
and left the room.</p>

<p>"Go with him, Meeta; you must have much to say."</p>

<p>"Nothing that we cannot say as well to-morrow. And
now you must take another sleeping draught, for I see Ernest
has carried off all the effect of your last."</p>

<p>Meeta spoke cheerfully, yet her heart was sad, she scarcely
knew why. She would not think Ernest unkind, yet how different
had been their meeting from that which fancy had so
often sketched for her!</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_151' id='Page_151' title='151'>&nbsp;</a>Franz Rainer fell asleep, and again Meeta returned to the
parlor. A lamp was still burning there, and by its dim light
she saw the form of Ernest extended on a settee with his cloak
and valise for his bed and pillow. At first she drew timidly
back into the chamber, but as the slight noise she had made
before perceiving him, had failed to disturb him, she felt assured
that he slept soundly, and an irresistible desire arose in
her heart to draw near him, and look at him more closely than
she had yet ventured to do. She stood beside him; her heart
bounded against the locket, his gift, which lay in its accustomed
place, as she marked with a quick eye how the handsome
but uncouth stripling had expanded into the man of
noble proportions, whose features had, like her own, acquired
a new character under the refining touch of intellect. Meeta
looked on him till her eyes grew dim with tears pressed from a
heart full of emotion, compounded of happy memories and
glad hopes, shadowed by disappointment and saddened by
doubt. Above all other feelings, however, rose the undying
love which had "grown with her growth, and strengthened
with her strength." Suddenly, by an irrepressible impulse, she
laid her hand softly on the dark locks of waving hair which
clustered over his broad brow, and breathed in low, tender accents,
"My Ernest!"</p>

<p>On leaving his father's room, Ernest had thrown himself
on his hard couch, not to sleep, but to rest; and when slumber
overpowered him, he had yielded to it unwillingly, and with
the determination to be on the alert and ready to arise on the
first summons. Sleep that comes thus, howsoever it may continue
through other disturbing causes, rarely resists a touch, or
the sound of our own name, and light as was Meeta's touch,
and low as were her tones, Ernest was partially aroused by
them. He stirred, and she would have retreated noiselessly
from his side, but as his eyes unclosed, they fell upon her with<a class='page' name ='Page_152' id='Page_152' title='152'>&nbsp;</a>
an expression of such rapturous love as she had never seen in
them before, and in an instant he had encircled her form with
his arm, and drawn her to his bosom. In glad surprise she
rested there a moment; it was but a moment.</p>

<p>"Sophie&mdash;my Sophie!" were the murmured words that
met her ear, and gave her strength to burst from his embraces
and glide rapidly, noiselessly back into the darkened chamber.
There, sheltered by the darkness, she could see Ernest raise
himself slowly up from his couch, look almost wildly around
him, and then seemingly satisfied that he had only dreamed,
sink back again to rest.</p>

<p>A dream it had indeed been to him; a shadow of the
night; to Meeta a dark cloud, in whose gloom she was henceforth
to walk for ever. Hours of conversation could not so
fully have revealed the truth to Meeta as those simple words:
"Sophie&mdash;my Sophie!" uttered by Ernest in such a tone of
heart-worship. Ernest loved with all the fond idolatry which
she had thought of late belonged not to man's affections; but
he loved another. Jealousy; the bitter consciousness of her
own slighted love; the memory of his vows; the crushing
thought that she was nothing to him now; that while he had
been the life of her life, another had filled his thoughts and
ruled his being, created a wild tempest in her soul. All was
still around her. The sick man, the tired Ernest slept; and
without, not even the rustling of a leaf disturbed the repose of
Nature. She seemed to herself the only living thing in the
universe; and to her, life was torture. An hour passed in this
still concentrated agony, and she could endure it no longer;
she must be up and doing; she would wake Ernest; she
would tell him the revelation she had made; upbraid him with
her blighted life, and leave him. Let him send for his Sophie;
what did she, the outcast, the rejected, there in his house?&mdash;why
should she nurse his father? She arose and approached<a class='page' name ='Page_153' id='Page_153' title='153'>&nbsp;</a>
again the couch of Ernest; she was about to call to him, but
she was arrested by the expression of agony in his face.
His brow was contracted, and as she continued to gaze, low
moans issued from his quivering lips. Ernest too was a
sufferer; how that thought softened the hard, cold, icy crust
that had been gathering around her heart! The bitterness of
pride and jealousy gave place to tenderer emotions. Tears
gathered in her eyes, and stealing softly back to her sheltered
seat, she wept long and silently.</p>

<p>"In sorrow the angels are near;" and Meeta's heart was
now full of sorrow, not of anger. Sad must her life ever be,
but what of that, if Ernest could be happy? Perhaps he suffered
for her; the good, true Ernest. It might be that only in
dreams he had told his love to Sophie, bound to silence, painful
silence, by his vows to her. She then could make him happy,
and was not that her first desire? If it were not, her love was a
low, selfish, unworthy love, and she would pray that it might be
purified. She did pray, not as she would have done an hour
before, to be taken out of the world, but that she might be
made meet to do the will of her <span class="smcap">Father</span> while in the world.
She prayed for herself, for Ernest; and sweet peace stole into her
heart, and before the morning light came, she had resolved not
to leave the old man who loved her, during his few remaining
days, yet not to keep Ernest in doubt of his own freedom.
She was impatient that he should awake, and fell asleep imagining
various modes of making her communication to him.
Exhausted by mental agitation even more than by watching,
she slept long and heavily. When she awoke, Ernest was
shading the window at her side, through which the sun was
shining brightly into the room. As she moved he looked at
her kindly, and said:</p>

<p>"I am afraid I awoke you, Meeta, when I meant only to
prolong your sleep by shutting out this light."</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_154' id='Page_154' title='154'>&nbsp;</a>"I have slept long enough," was all that Meeta could say.
The old Rainer was awake, and dreading above all things some
allusions from him to the supposed relations of Ernest and
herself, she hastened from the room and busied herself in the
preparation of breakfast. Having seen that meal placed upon
the table, she returned to the sick room and begged that Ernest
would pour out his own coffee, while she did some things that
were essential to his father's comfort. She lingered till Ernest
came to see whether he could take her place, and then, as the
old man slept peacefully, and she could make no further excuse,
she accompanied him back to the table. The breakfast, a mere
form to Meeta at least, proceeded in silence, or with only a
casual remark from Ernest, scarcely heard by her, on the
weather, the rapidity with which he had travelled, or his father's
condition. Suddenly Meeta seemed to arouse herself as from a
deep reverie:</p>

<p>"Why do you not talk to me of Sophie?" she said,
attempting to speak gayly, though one less embarrassed than
Ernest could not have failed to note the tremulousness of her
voice, and the quivering of the pallid lip which vainly strove to
smile.</p>

<p>But Meeta's agitation was as nothing to that of Ernest.
For a moment he gazed upon her as though spell-bound, then
dropping his face into his clasped hands, sat actually shivering
before her. It was plain that Ernest had not lightly estimated
his obligations to her. If he had sinned against them he had
not despised them, and this conviction gave new strength to
Meeta. She rose for the hour superior to every selfish emotion.
Laying her hand upon his arm, she said, gently:</p>

<p>"Be not so agitated, Ernest; can you not regard me as
your friend, and talk to me as you did in old days of all that
disturbs you; and why should you be disturbed at my speaking
of&mdash;of your Sophie? You do not suppose that&mdash;you know that<a class='page' name ='Page_155' id='Page_155' title='155'>&nbsp;</a>&mdash;in
short, Ernest, we cannot be expected to feel now as we
did five years ago; but surely that need not prevent our being
friends."</p>

<p>Meeta had been herself too much confused of late, to remark
her companion. When she now ventured with great effort to
meet his eyes, she found them fixed upon her with an expression
of lively admiration and grateful joy.</p>

<p>"Meeta, dear Meeta!" he exclaimed, seizing her hand and
kissing it. "You give me new life. I have been a miserable
man for weeks past, torn by conflicting claims upon my heart
and my honor. You had claims on both, Meeta; sacred claims,
which I could never have asked you to forego; and so had
Sophie, for though I resisted long, there came a moment of
mad passion, of madder forgetfulness, in which, abandoning
myself to the present, I sought and obtained an avowal of her
love. It was scarcely over ere I felt the wrong I had done. I
revealed that wrong to her; pity me, Meeta! I told her all&mdash;your
claims, your worth. To you I resolved to be equally
frank, and my only hope was in your generosity. But my
father had never suffered me to doubt that your heart was still
mine, and though I was assured that you would enable me to
fulfil my obligations to Sophie, I feared, I mean, I could not
hope, that it would be without any sacrifice; I mean without
any regrets on your part."</p>

<p>Ernest paused in some embarrassment; but Meeta could
not speak, and he resumed:</p>

<p>"You have made me perfectly happy, Meeta, which even
Sophie could not have done, had I been compelled in devoting
myself to her to relinquish the friend and sister of my childhood."</p>

<p>"Always regard me thus, Ernest, as your friend and sister,
and I shall be satisfied."</p>

<p>Meeta had risen to return to the sick room, but Ernest
caught her hand and held her back, while he said:</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_156' id='Page_156' title='156'>&nbsp;</a>"But you must see my Sophie, Meeta; you must know her
and then you will love her too. She will be here soon with
her sister, Mrs. Schwartz."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Schwartz her sister? Then my last doubt is removed
Ernest. She is worthy of you."</p>

<p>"Worthy of me!" And Ernest would have run into all a
lover's rhapsodies on this text, but Meeta had escaped from him.</p>

<p>Hitherto Meeta's life had been one of quietness, of inaction,
and now in a few short weeks ages of active existence seemed
crowded. One object she had set before her as the great aim
of her life; it was to secure Ernest's happiness and preserve his
honor. She understood now the coldness with which her
father had of late named him. It was essential to her peace
that this coldness should not deepen into anger. Not even in
her own family then must she have rest from the strife between
her inner and her outer life. Sympathy she must not have,
since sympathy with her was almost inseparably connected with
reproach of Ernest. Time had another lesson to teach, and
Meeta soon learned it; that in a combat such as she had to
sustain, no half-way measures would suffice, that she must not
drive her griefs down to the depths of her heart, shutting them
there from every human eye, but she must drive them out of
her heart. We talk of feigning cheerfulness, of wearing a mask
for the world and throwing it off in solitude, and we may do
this for a week, a month, a year, but those who have a life-grief
to sustain, from whose hearts hope has died out, know that
there are only two paths open to them in the universe; to lie
down in their despair and breathe out their souls in murmurs
against their <span class="smcap">God</span>, and lamentations over their destiny; or,
humbly kissing the rod which has smitten them, to go forth
out of themselves, where all is darkness and woe, and find a
new and happier life in living for and in others. And thus did
Meeta.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_157' id='Page_157' title='157'>&nbsp;</a>We may not linger over the details of the next few weeks
of her existence. The old Rainer died; died blessing his
children, Ernest and Meeta, and praying for their happiness.
Often would Ernest have told him all; but Meeta kept back a
disclosure which would have given him pain. "Do not disturb
him now, Ernest," she said; "he will know all soon, and bless
your Sophie from heaven, where there is no sorrow."</p>

<p>Meeta returned home, and exhaustion won for her a few
days rest; rest even from her mental struggles; but when the
funeral was over, and things returned to their usual routine, she
felt that she must prepare her father and mother to receive
Ernest in the character in which they were henceforth to regard
him. She found strength for this in her lofty purpose and her
simple dependence upon Heaven, and her voice did not falter
nor her color change as she said to her mother:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you not think Ernest is much altered?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is greatly improved."</p>

<p>"Improved! Well, he may be so to the eyes of others,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is he not as tender to you, my daughter?" asked the sensitive
mother.</p>

<p>"That is not it," said Meeta, coloring for the first time:
"we neither of us feel as we once did; it was a childish folly
to suppose that we should. I have told Ernest that I could not
fulfil our engagement, and he is satisfied."</p>

<p>Madame Werner looked long at her daughter, but Meeta
met the glance firmly.</p>

<p>"And is this all, Meeta?"</p>

<p>"All! What more would you have, dear mother?"</p>

<p>"And are you happy, Meeta?"</p>

<p>"Happier than I should be in marrying Ernest now, dear
mother."</p>

<p>Madame Werner explained all this to her husband, at her<a class='page' name ='Page_158' id='Page_158' title='158'>&nbsp;</a>
daughter's request. He was not grieved at it. "Ernest," he
said, "had never valued Meeta as she deserved. He was glad
she had shown so much spirit."</p>

<p>Meeta had a more difficult task to perform. Mrs. Schwartz's
sister has come at last. She came from Germany at the same
time with Ernest, but stopped to make a visit to another sister
in Philadelphia, and arrived here only last night. "I will go
and see her," said Meeta one morning to Madame Werner.
She went. As she approached the house, there came through
the open windows the sound of an organ, accompanied by a
rich and highly cultivated voice. Meeta would not pause for a
moment, lest she should grow nervous. It was essential to
Ernest's happiness that Sophie should be friendly with her;
and the difficulties were of a nature which, if not overcome at
once, would not be overcome at all. Meeta entered the small
parlor without knocking, and found herself <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with the
musician; a young, fair girl, delicately formed, with beautiful
hands and arms, and pleasing, pretty face. As she saw the
visitor, her song ceased. Meeta smiled on her, and extending
her hand, said: "You are Sophie&mdash;Ernest's Sophie?"</p>

<p>"And you," said the fair girl, with wondering eyes, "are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Meeta."</p>

<p>This was an introduction which admitted no formality, and
when Mrs. Schwartz entered half an hour later, she was surprised
to find those so lately strangers conversing in the low
and earnest tones which betoken confidence, while the lofty expression
on the countenance of the one, and the moist eyes and
flushed cheeks of the other, showed that their topic was one of
no ordinary interest.</p>

<p>Six months passed rapidly away, and then Ernest felt that
he might, without disrespect to his father's memory, bring
home his bride. Their engagement had been known for some
time, and had excited no little surprise; though perhaps less<a class='page' name ='Page_159' id='Page_159' title='159'>&nbsp;</a>
than the continued and close friendship between them and
Meeta. Many improvements in Sophie's future home had been
suggested by Meeta's taste, and Ernest had acquired such a
habit of consulting her, that no day passed without an interview
between them. At length the evening preceding the
bridal-day had arrived, and Ernest and Sophie had gone to secure
Meeta's promise to officiate as bridesmaid in the simple
ceremony of the morrow. They were to be married at the
parsonage, in the presence of a few witnesses only, and were
immediately to set out on an excursion which would occupy
several weeks. They had urged Meeta to accompany them,
but she had declined. "But she cannot refuse to stand up with
me&mdash;do you think she can?" said Sophie to her sister, as she
prepared to accompany Ernest to Carl Werner's.</p>

<p>"I do not think she <i>will</i> refuse," Mrs. Schwartz replied.</p>

<p>"You do not think she will!" repeated Mr. Schwartz, in
an accent of surprise, to his wife, when Ernest and Sophie had
left them. "How does that consist with your idea of Meeta's
love for Ernest?"</p>

<p>"It perfectly consists with a love like Meeta's; a love without
any alloy of selfishness. Dear Meeta! how little is her
nobleness appreciated! Even I dare not let her see that she is
understood by me, lest I should wound her delicate and generous
nature."</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then Mr. Schwartz said, hesitatingly,
"If it be as you think, Meeta is a noble being; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If it be!" interrupted Mrs. Schwartz, with warmth. "Can
you doubt it? Have you not seen the loftier character which
her generous purpose has impressed upon her whole aspect?
the elevation&mdash;I had almost said the inspiration, which beams
from her face when Ernest and Sophia are present? Sophie is
my sister, and I love her truly; yet I declare to you, at such
times I have looked from her to Meeta, and wondered at what
seemed to me Ernest's infatuation."</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_160' id='Page_160' title='160'>&nbsp;</a>"Sophie is fair, and delicate, and accomplished, the very
personification of refinement, natural and acquired, and the antipodes
of all which Ernest, ere he saw her, had begun to dread
in the untaught Meeta of his memory. I am not surprised at
all at his loving Sophie, but I cannot at all understand how the
simple and single-hearted Meeta can feign so long and so well,
as on your supposition she has done."</p>

<p>"Feign! Meeta feign! I never said or thought such a
thing. A course of action lofty as Meeta's must have its
foundation deep in the heart, in principles enduring as life
itself. Had Meeta's been the commonplace feigned satisfaction
with Ernest's conduct to which pride might have given birth,
she would have been fitful in her moods; alternately gay or
gloomy; generous and kind, or petulant and exacting. The
serenity, the composure of countenance and manner which distinguish
our Meeta, spring from a higher, purer source. It
is the sweet submission of a chastened, loving spirit, which
can say to its <span class="smcap">Father</span> in Heaven:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
<table class='poem' border='0'><tr><td>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<span class="smcap">Because</span> my portion was assign'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wholesome and bitter, <span class="smcap">Thou</span> art kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I am blessed to my mind.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table></div>

<p>"A state of feeling to be preferred certainly to the gratification
of any earthly affection; but I scarcely see how it can
accord with Meeta's continued love of Ernest."</p>

<p>"That is because you do not separate love from the selfish
desires with which it is too generally accompanied. Meeta
loves Ernest so truly, so entirely, that she cannot be said to
yield her happiness to his, but rather to find it in his; his joy,
his honor, are hers."</p>

<p>"And can woman feel thus?" asked Mr. Schwartz, as he
looked with admiration upon his wife, her cheeks glowing<a class='page' name ='Page_161' id='Page_161' title='161'>&nbsp;</a>
and her eyes lighted with the enthusiasm of a spirit akin
to Meeta's.</p>

<p>"There are many mysteries in woman which you have yet
to fathom," said Mrs. Schwartz, with a smile.</p>

<p>To the good pastor and his wife, the next day, even Sophie
was a less interesting object of contemplation than Meeta, who
stood at her side. She was pale, very pale, and dressed with
even more than usual simplicity; yet there was in her face so
much of the soul's light, that she seemed to them beautiful.
Her congratulations were offered in speechless emotion. The
brotherly kiss which Ernest pressed upon her cheek called up
no color there, nor disturbed the graceful stillness of her manner;
and when Sophie, who had really become sincerely attached
to her, threw herself into her arms, she returned her
embrace with tenderness, whispering as she did so, "Make
Ernest happy, Sophie, and I will love you always!"</p>

<p>And now what have we more to tell of Meeta? It cannot
be denied that there were hours of darkness, in which the
joyous hopes and memories of her youth rose up vividly before
her, making her present life seem sad and lonely in contrast.
But these visitors from the realm of shadows were neither
evoked nor welcomed by Meeta. Resolutely she turned from
the dead past, to the active, living present, determined that no
shadow from her should darken the declining days of her
father and mother. She is the light of their home, and often
they bless the Providence which has left her with them.
What would they have done without her cheerful voice to inspire
them in bearing the burdens of advancing life?</p>

<p>But not only in her home was Meeta a consolation and a
blessing. The poor, the sick, the sorrowing, knew ever where
to find true sympathy and ready aid. She was the "Lady
Bountiful" of her neighborhood. But there was one house
where more especially her presence was welcomed; where no<a class='page' name ='Page_162' id='Page_162' title='162'>&nbsp;</a>
important step was taken without her advice; where sorrow
was best soothed by her, and joy but half complete till she had
shared it. This house was Ernest Rainer's. To him and Sophie
she was a cherished sister, to whose upright and self-forgetting
nature they looked up with a species of reverence; and to their
children she was "Dear Aunt Meeta! the kindest and best
friend, except mamma, in the world!"</p>

<p>How many more useful, more noble, or happier persons
than our old maid can married life present? Is she not more
worthy of imitation than the "Celias" and "Daphnes" whose
delicate distresses have formed the staple of circulating
libraries, or than those feeble spirits in real life, who, mistaking
selfishness for sensibility, turn thanklessly from the blessings and
coldly from the duties of life, because they have been denied
the gratification of some cherished desire?</p>

<p>It is Christmas, merry Christmas, as we have been duly informed
this morning by every inhabitant of Donaldson Manor,
from Col. Donaldson to the pet and baby Sophy Dudley, who
was taught the words but yesterday, for the occasion. Last
evening our readings were interrupted, for all were busy in
preparing for this important day. Miss Donaldson was superintending
jellies and blanc-manges, custards and Charlottes des
Russes; Col. and Mrs. Donaldson were preparing gifts for their
servants, not one of whom was forgotten, and Annie and I, and,
by his own special request, Mr. Arlington, were arranging in
proper order the gifts of that most considerate, mirthful and
generous of spirits, Santa Claus. This morning the sun rose as
clear and bright as though it, too, rejoiced in the joy of humanity;
but long before the sun had showed himself, little feet
were pattering from room to room, and childish voices shouting
in the unchecked exuberance of delight. I sometimes doubt
whether the children are so happy as I am, on such occasions.
One incident that occurred this morning would have been
enough, in my opinion, to repay all the time, the trouble, and
the gold, which Santa Claus, or his agents, had expended on
their preparations. Aroused by the voices of the children, I
threw on a dressing-gown and hastened to the room appropriated
to their patron saint, which I entered at one door just
as little Eva Dudley appeared at another. Without being in<a class='page' name ='Page_164' id='Page_164' title='164'>&nbsp;</a>
the least a beauty, Eva has the most charming face I know;
merry and bright as Puck's, or as her own life, which from its
earliest dawn has been joyous as a bird's carol. She gazed
now with eager delight on the toys exhibited by her brothers
and sisters, without, apparently, one thought of herself, till
Robert said, "But see here, Eva, look at your own."</p>

<p>As her eyes rested on the large baby-house, with its folding-doors
open to display the furniture of the parlors, and the two
dolls, mother and daughter, seated at a table on which stood a
neat china breakfasting set, she clasped her dimpled hands in
silent ecstasy for half a minute, then rising to her utmost
height on her rosy little toes, she exclaimed, "Oh, isn't I a
happy little woman!"</p>

<p>Dear Eva! a little <i>girl's</i> heart would not have seemed to
her large enough to contain such a rapture.</p>

<p>Our party has been augmented since breakfast by the
arrival of several families of Donaldsons&mdash;some of whom live
at too great a distance for visits at any other time than Christmas,
when all who stand in any conceivable, or I was about to
say inconceivable, degree of relationship to the Donaldsons of
Donaldson Manor, are expected to be here. Among this host
of uncles and aunts and cousins, I was really grateful for my
own prefix of aunt, and I heard Mr. Arlington whisper a
request to Robert to call him uncle&mdash;a title to which I have no
doubt he would willingly make good his claim.</p>

<p>In the midst of this general hilarity, the religious character
of the day was not forgotten, and all the family and some of
the visitors attended the morning services in the church. We
know that there are those who, doubting the testimony on
which the Christian world has agreed to observe the 25th of
December as the birthday into our mortal life of the world's
Saviour, and the era from which man may date his hopes of a
happy immortality, consider the religious observances of this day<a class='page' name ='Page_165' id='Page_165' title='165'>&nbsp;</a>
a sheer superstition. On such a controversy I could say but little,
and I should be very unwilling so say that little here; but I would
ask if it can be wrong in the opinion of any&mdash;nay, if it be not
right, very right, in the opinion of all&mdash;to celebrate once in the
year an event so solemn and so joyous to our race; and whether
any day can be better for such a purpose, than that which has
been for centuries associated with it wherever the Angel's song
of "Peace on earth and good will to man" has been heard?
Another class of objectors there are who complain that a day so
sacred should be desecrated, as they express it, by revelry and
mirth. To their objection I should not have a word of reply,
if it were limited to a condemnation of that wild uproar and
senseless jollity by which men sometimes make fools or brutes
of themselves; but when they condemn the cheerfulness that
has its home and its birthplace in a grateful heart, when they
frown upon the happy family gathering once more within the
old walls that had echoed to their childish gambols, calling up
by the spells of association, from the dim recesses of the past,
the very tones and looks of the mother that watched their
cradled sleep, and the father that guided their first tottering
steps in the pursuit of truth; tones and looks by which, if by
any thing, the cold, selfish spirit of the world to whose dominion
they have yielded, may be exorcised, and the loving and
generous spirit of their earlier life may again enter within them;
when they declare these things inconsistent with the Christian's
joyful commemoration of that event to which he owes his
earthly blessings as well as his heavenly hopes. I can only
pity them for their want of harmony with the Great Spirit of
the Universe, the spirit of Love and Joy.</p>

<p>Our Christmas was continued and concluded in the same
spirit in which it was commenced&mdash;the spirit of kindly affection
to Man and devout gratitude to Heaven. Those guests whose
homes were distant remained for the night, and in the evening,<a class='page' name ='Page_166' id='Page_166' title='166'>&nbsp;</a>
before any of our party had left us, Col. Donaldson called on
Robert Dudley to repeat a poem winch he had learned at his
request for the occasion. Robert was a little abashed at first
at being brought forward so conspicuously; but he is a manly,
intelligent boy, and his voice soon gathered strength and
firmness, and his eyes lost their downward tendency, and
kindled with earnest feeling, as he recited those beautiful lines
of Charles Sprague, entitled&mdash;</p>

<p>Yesterday we were more than usually still after the enjoyment
of Christmas, and a little quiet chit-chat seemed all of
which we were capable, but to-day every thing about us and
within us began to settle into its usual form, and this evening
there was a general call for our accustomed entertainment. I
was inexorable to all entreaties, and Mr. Arlington was compelled
to open his portfolio for our gratification.</p>

<p>"Select your subject," he said with a smile, as he drew forth
sketch after sketch and spread them on the table before us. "I

<p>"I select this," said Annie, as she held up a drawing, entitled,
"The Exiled Hebrews."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mr. Arlington, as he glanced at it, "you have
chosen well; the subject is interesting."</p>

<p>"But can you really tell us nothing of these figures, so noble
yet so touching in their aspect?"</p>

<p>"No; nothing of <i>them</i>. I could tell you indeed of a <i>dying</i>
Hebrew, whose portrait you may imagine you have before you
in that turbaned old gentleman."</p>

<p>"Well, let us hear it."</p>

<p>"Have I fulfilled my task?" asked Mr. Arlington, as he
touched the picture on which Annie's eyes were still fixed.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_172' id='Page_172' title='172'>&nbsp;</a>"By no means," she answered; "the poem is beautiful; but
is the drawing from your own pencil?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! It is a copy of a copy. The original is by
Biederrmanns, and may be seen, I believe, in the Dresden Gallery.
This sketch was made from a copy in the possession of
my friend, Mr. Michael Grahame. He had it done while he
was in Russia. By-the-by&mdash;if I had Aunt Nancy's powers as
a <i>raconteur</i>, I think I could interest you in the history of Mr.
and Mrs. Grahame."</p>

<p>"Let us have it," exclaimed Col. Donaldson; "we will be
lenient in our criticisms; and should we ever call on you to
give it to severer critics, Aunt Nancy will dress it up for you."</p>

<p>Mr. Arlington in vain sought to excuse himself.</p>

<p>"It is of no use," cried Col. Donaldson; "I am a thoroughbred
story hunter, and now you have shown me the game, I
must have it."</p>

<p>To Mr. Arlington, therefore, the reader is indebted for the
following incidents, though I have fulfilled the promise made
for me by the Colonel, and dressed it up a little for its present
appearance. I have called the narrative thus prepared,</p>

<p>With beauty, wealth, an accomplished education, and a home
around which clustered all the warm affections and graceful
amenities of life, Lilian Devoe was considered by her acquaintances
as one of fortune's most favored children. Yet in Lilian's
bright sky there was a cloud, though it was perceptible to none
but herself. She was the daughter of an Englishman, who, on
his arrival in America with a sickly wife and infant child, had
esteemed himself fortunate in obtaining the situation of farm-steward,
or bailiff, at Mr. Trevanion's country-seat, near New-York.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_173' id='Page_173' title='173'>&nbsp;</a>"This is a pleasant home, Gerald," said Mrs. Devoe, on the
day she took possession of her small but neat cottage, as she
stood with him beneath a porch embowered with honey-suckle,
and looked out upon a scene to which hill and dale and river
combined to give enchantment.</p>

<p>"If you can be well and happy in it, love, I will try and forget
that I had a right to a better," said Gerald Devoe, with a grave
yet tender smile, as he drew his invalid wife close to his side.</p>

<p>Grave, Gerald Devoe always was; and none wondered at it
who knew his early history. His family belonged to the gentry
of England, and he had been born to an inheritance sufficient
to support him respectably in that class. His mother, from
whom he derived a sound judgment, and a firm and vigorous
mind, died while he was yet a child, leaving his weak and self-indulgent
father to the management of a roguish attorney, by
whose aid he made the future maintain the present, till, at his
death, little was left to Gerald beyond the bare walls of his
paternal home and the small park by which it was surrounded.
He had been, for two years before this time, married to one
who had brought him little wealth, and whose delicate health
seemed to demand the luxuries which he could no longer
afford. For her sake, far more than for his own&mdash;even more
than for that of his cherished child&mdash;he shrank from the new
condition under which life was presenting itself to him. When
at length his resources utterly failed, and he could no longer
veil the truth from his wife, her gentle tender smile, her confiding
caress, and above all, her ready inquiry into his plans for
the future, and her earnest effort to aid him in bringing the
chaos of his mind into order, taught him that there lies in
woman's affections a source of strength equal to all the requirements
of those who have won their way to that hidden fountain.
It was by her advice that, instead of wasting his energies
in the vain struggle to maintain his present position, he deter<a class='page' name ='Page_174' id='Page_174' title='174'>&nbsp;</a>mined
to carve out for himself a new life in another land. The
first step towards the fulfilment of this resolution was also the
most painful. It was the sacrifice of his home, the home of his
childhood, his youth, his manhood, with which all that was
dear in the present or tender in the past was associated. And
yet higher claims it had. It had been the home of his fathers.
For three hundred years those walls had owned a Devoe for
their master, and now they must pass into a stranger's hands,
and he and his must go forth with no right even to a grave in
that soil which had seemed ever an inalienable part of himself.
It was a stern lesson, but life teaches well, and it was learned.
He could not turn to the liberal professions for support, because
he had no means of maintaining himself and his family during
the preparatory studies. Of farming he knew already something,
and spent some months in acquiring yet further information
respecting it, before he sailed from England. The determination
and energy with which Gerald Devoe had entered on
his new career, had won for him friends among practical men,
and when he left England it was with recommendations that
insured his success.</p>

<p>It was a fortunate circumstance for Mr. and Mrs. Devoe that
Mr. Trevanion required a farm-steward on their arrival, for in
him and his wife they found liberal employers, and persons of
true Christian benevolence, who, having discovered the superiority
of their minds and manners to their present station, hesitated
not to receive them into their circle of friends, when a
knowledge of their past history had acquainted them with their
claims on their sympathy. Howsoever valuable the friendship
of persons at once so accomplished and so excellent was to Mr.
and Mrs. Devoe, for their own sakes, they prized it yet more
for their Lilian's. She was their only child, and their poverty
lost its last sting when they saw her linked arm in arm with
young Anna Trevanion, the companion of her lessons and her<a class='page' name ='Page_175' id='Page_175' title='175'>&nbsp;</a>
sports. They could not have borne to see her, so lovely in
outward form, and with a mind so full of intelligence, condemned
either to the dreariness of a life without companionship,
or to the degradation of association with the rude and
uncultivated. That this feeling was wholly unconnected with
any false views of their own position, or vain estimation of the
claims derived from their birth and former condition, was evident
from their readiness to receive into their friendly regards
those in their present sphere in whose moral qualities they
could confide, and who did not repel their courtesies by a rude
and coarse manner. There was one of this latter class who
held a place in their esteem not less exalted than that occupied
by Mr. Trevanion himself. This was a Scotchman, living within
two miles of Mr. Trevanion's seat, who found at once an agreeable
occupation and a respectable support in a garden, from
which he supplied the markets of New-York with some of their
choicest vegetables, and its drawing-rooms with some of their
choicest bouquets. Mr. Grahame was one who, in those early
ages when physical endowments constituted the chief distinction
between men, might have been chosen king of the tribe
with which he had chanced to be associated. Even now, in
this self-styled enlightened age, his tall and stalwart frame, his
erect carriage, his firm and vigorous step, his broad, commanding
brow, his bright, keen eye, and the firm, frank expression
of his whole face, won from every beholder an involuntary
feeling of respect, which further acquaintance only served to
deepen. With little of the education of schools, he was a man
of reading, and, what schools can never make, he was a man
of thought, and of that sober, practical good sense, and those
firm, religious principles which are the surest, the only true and
safe guides in life. Mrs. Grahame was a gentle and lovely
woman, with an eye to see and a heart to feel her husband's
excellences. And a worthy son of such a father was Michael<a class='page' name ='Page_176' id='Page_176' title='176'>&nbsp;</a>
Grahame, the only child of this excellent pair. He was six
years older than Lilian Devoe, and having no sister of his own,
had been her playfellow and protector from her cradle. Even
Anna Trevanion could not rival Michael in Lilian's heart, nor
all the luxuries of Trevanion Hall compete with the delight of
wandering with him through the gardens of Mossgiel, listening
to his history of the various plants&mdash;for Michael had learned
from his father where most of them had first been found, and
how and by whom they had been introduced to their present
abodes&mdash;and learning from him the chief points of distinction
between the different tribes of the vegetable world, and many
other things of which older people are often ignorant. But
acquainted as Michael was with the inhabitants of the garden,
they did not afford him his most vivid enjoyment. Mechanical
pursuits were his passion.</p>

<p>Before Lilian was four years old, she had ridden in a carriage
of his construction, which he boasted the most unskilful
hand on the most unequal road could not, except from <i>malice
prepense</i>, upset. To see Michael a clergyman, or, if that might
not be, a lawyer, was Mrs. Grahame's dream of life; but when
she whispered it to her husband, he shook his head, with a
grave smile, and pointed to the boy, who stood near, putting
the finishing touch to what he called his "magical glass."
This was the case of an old spy-glass, in which he had so disposed
several mirrors, made of a toilet-glass long since broken,
as to enable the person using the instrument to see objects in a
very different direction from that to which it appeared to be
directed. The fond parents watched his movements in silence
for a few minutes: suddenly he called in a glad voice, "Here,
father, come and look through my magical glass."</p>

<p>Mr. Grahame obeyed the summons, saying to his wife,
"He'll make a good mechanic&mdash;better not spoil that, for a poor
clergyman or lawyer."</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_177' id='Page_177' title='177'>&nbsp;</a>Michael had the advantage of the best schools to which his
father could gain access; and his teachers joined in declaring
that his father might make what he would of him, but his own
inclination for mechanics continued as fixed as ever, and Mr.
Grahame was equally fixed in his determination to let his inclination
decide his career.</p>

<p>"Let him be what he will, he must be something above the
ordinary, or your high people will remember against him that
his father was a gardener," said Mr. Grahame to his wife; "and
you may be sure he'll rise highest in what he loves."</p>

<p>At sixteen Michael Grahame commenced his apprenticeship
to the trade of a mathematical instrument maker, to the perfect
satisfaction of himself and his father, the secret annoyance of
his mother, and the openly expressed chagrin of Lilian Devoe,
who had shared all Mrs. Grahame's ambitious hopes for her
friend. From this period Lilian became the inseparable companion
of the young Trevanions, their only rival in her heart
being removed from her circle. She still considered Michael as
greatly superior to them, and indeed to all others, in personal
attributes, but she could seldom enjoy his society, since he
resided in the city; and as she approached to womanhood, and
he exchanged the vivacity of the boy for the man's thoughtful
brow and more controlled expression of feeling, their manner in
their occasional interviews assumed a formality which made it
a poor interpreter of her heart's true emotions.</p>

<p>At seventeen Lilian Devoe was an orphan, left to the guardianship
of Mr. Trevanion and Mr. Grahame, with a fortune
which secured to her a prospect of all the comforts, and many
of the elegancies of life. This fortune was the result of a successful
speculation made by Mr. Devoe about a year before his
death, with the little sum, which, by judicious management,
he had saved from his salary during many years. It was a
sum too small to secure to his daughter a maintenance in case<a class='page' name ='Page_178' id='Page_178' title='178'>&nbsp;</a>
of his death, and with a trembling and almost despairing heart
he had thrown it on the troubled sea of speculation. From
that hour he knew no peace. His life was probably shortened
by his anxieties, and when he received the assurance of the
successful issue of his experiment, he had but a few days to
live. Before his death, Mr. Trevanion had spoken very kindly
to him, and both he and Mrs. Trevanion had expressed the most
friendly interest in Lilian, and had offered to receive her as a
member of their own family, when her "home should be left
unto her desolate." Mr. Grahame and his kind-hearted wife
had already made the same offer, and Mr. Devoe, with the
warmest expression of gratitude, commended his daughter to
the guardianship of both his friends. It was winter when Mr.
Devoe died&mdash;the Trevanions were in the city, and, by her own
wish, Lilian passed the first few months of her orphanage at the
cottage of Mr. Grahame. Never was an orphan more tenderly
received, more dearly cherished.</p>

<p>Michael Grahame had now acquired his trade, and had entered
into an already established and profitable business with
his former master, who predicted that with his application, and
his unusual talent and his delight both in the theory of mechanics
and the actual development of that theory in practice,
he must one day acquire a high reputation. Perhaps this
opinion might have been in some degree shaken by the long
and frequent holidays of his young partner during this winter.
Michael had never been so much at home since he left it, a boy
of sixteen, and before the winter had passed, all formality between
him and Lilian had vanished. Again they wandered
together, as in childhood, through the garden walks; again
Lilian learned to regard him, not only as a loved friend, but
as a guide and protector.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grahame saw the growth of these feelings with delight.
She loved Lilian, and gave the highest proof of her<a class='page' name ='Page_179' id='Page_179' title='179'>&nbsp;</a>
esteem for her, in believing her worthy of her son. Mr.
Grahame was less satisfied. He, too, loved Lilian, and would
have welcomed her to his heart as a daughter, but her lately
acquired fortune, and her connection with the Trevanion family,
gave her a right to higher expectations in marriage, than to
become the wife of a mechanic of very moderate fortunes, howsoever
great was his ability, or howsoever distinguished his
personal qualities. No&mdash;Mr. Grahame was not satisfied, and
nothing but his confidence in Michael kept him silent. The
confidence was not misplaced.</p>

<p>The news of Lilian's fortune, and of Mr. and Mrs. Trevanion's
offer to receive her into their family, had sent a sharp
pang through the heart of Michael Grahame, which had taught
him the true character of his attachment to her.</p>

<p>"She is removed from my world&mdash;she can be nothing to
me now," was the first stern whisper of his heart, which was
modified after two or three interviews into&mdash;"She can only be
a dear friend and sister. I must never think of her in any
other light." And, devoted as he had been to her through
the winter, no word, no look had told of love less calm or more
exacting than this. But there came a time when the quick
blush on Lilian's cheek at his approach, the tremor of her little
hand as he clasped it, told that she shared his feeling, without
his power of self-control. Then came the hour of trial to
Michael Grahame's nature. Self-immolation were easy in comparison
with the infliction of one pang on her. And wherefore
should either suffer? Was it not a false sentiment that denied
to her the right to decide for herself, between those shows and
fashions which the world most prizes, and the indulgence of
the purest and sweetest affections of our nature? Was he
not in truth sacrificing her happiness to his own pride? It
was a question which he dared not answer for himself, and he
applied to his father, in whose high principles and clear judg<a class='page' name ='Page_180' id='Page_180' title='180'>&nbsp;</a>ment
he placed implicit confidence. Mr. Grahame was too
shrewd, and in this case too interested an observer to be unprepared
for his son's avowal of his past feelings and present
perplexities.</p>

<p>"You are right, my son," he replied to his appeal; "It is
Lilian's right to decide for herself on that which will constitute
her own happiness."</p>

<p>"Then I may speak to her&mdash;I may tell her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All you desire that she should know," said Mr. Grahame,
gently, "when Lilian has had an opportunity of knowing what
she must sacrifice in accepting you."</p>

<p>"True&mdash;true&mdash;I will ask no promise from her&mdash;nay&mdash;I will
accept none&mdash;I will only assure her that should the world fail
to fill her heart, the truest and most devoted love awaits her
here."</p>

<p>"And in listening to that assurance, without rebuking it, a
delicate woman would feel that she had pledged herself."</p>

<p>Michael Grahame's brow contracted, and his voice faltered
slightly as, after a moment's thoughtful pause, he asked, "What
then would you have me do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at present&mdash;Lilian will soon leave us, and at Mr.
Trevanion's she will see quite another kind of life&mdash;a life which,
with her fortune and their friendship, may be hers, but which
she must give up should she become the wife of a mechanic
and the daughter-in-law of a gardener. Let her see this life,
my boy, and then let her choose between you and it."</p>

<p>"And how can I hope that she will continue to regard me
with kindness if I suffer her to depart without any expression
of interest in her?"</p>

<p>"Any expression of interest! I do not wish you to be colder
to her than you have hitherto been, and I am much mistaken
if Lilian would exchange your <i>brotherly</i> affection for all the
gewgaws in life."</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_181' id='Page_181' title='181'>&nbsp;</a>"I will endeavor to take your advice, but I hope I shall not
be tried too long," were the concluding words of Michael
Grahame, as he turned from his father to seek composure in a
solitary walk. When he had returned, he found that his
father had gone to the city&mdash;an unusual circumstance at that
season, and one which he could not afterwards avoid connecting
with a letter which Lilian received the next day from Anna
Trevanion, before she had risen from the breakfast table.</p>

<p>"Papa," wrote Miss Trevanion, "has made me perfectly
happy, dear Lilian, by declaring that he cannot consent to leave
you longer in the country. I hope you will not find it very
difficult to obey his commands in the present instance, which
are, that you shall be ready at noon to-morrow to accompany
him to the city, where you will find Mamma and your Anna,
waiting to receive you with open arms."</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Lilian? Does your letter bring you
bad news?" asked Mrs. Grahame, as she saw the dejected countenance
with which Lilian sat gazing on these few lines.</p>

<p>Michael said nothing, but, as Lilian looked up to answer
Mrs. Grahame, she saw that his eyes were fixed upon her, and
the blood rushed to her temples, while she said, "It is only a
note from Anna Trevanion, to say that her father is coming
for me to-day at noon,&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;" Lilian could go no farther&mdash;her
voice faltered, and she burst into tears. Michael
Grahame started from his chair, but a movement of his father's
arm prevented his approaching Lilian, and unable to endure
the scene, he rushed from the room, while his mother, folding
the weeping girl in her arms, exclaimed, "Don't cry, Lilian, Mr.
Trevanion will not certainly make you go with him, if you do
not wish it."</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, good wife," said the kind but firm voice of
Mr. Grahame; "Lilian must not be so ungracious to such
friends as Mr. and Mrs. Trevanion, as to refuse to go to them<a class='page' name ='Page_182' id='Page_182' title='182'>&nbsp;</a>
when they wish her. Go, my dear child," he continued, laying
his hand on her bent head; "and remember that no day will
be so happy for us as that in which you come back&mdash;if indeed,"
he added, more gayly, "you can come back to such an humble
home, after living among great folks."</p>

<p>There was another voice for which Lilian listened, but she
listened in vain. Her first feeling on perceiving that Michael
Grahame had left the room while she lay weeping in his mother's
arms was very bitter, but Mrs. Grahame soothed her by
saying, "Michael couldn't bear to see you crying, dear, so
when his father wouldn't let him speak to you, he jumped up
and ran off. Poor Michael! sadly enough he'll miss you."</p>

<p>In about an hour, Michael again sought Lilian, bringing
with him three bouquets of hot-house flowers. Two of these
had been arranged by his father for Mrs. and Miss Trevanion,
and the other was of flowers which he had himself selected for
Lilian. She stood beside him while he first wrapped the stems
of the flowers in a wet sponge, and then put them into a box,
to defend them from the cold. This was done, and the box
handed to Lilian without a word. As she took it, she asked in
a low tone, and turning away to hide her embarrassment as
she spoke, "When shall I see you in New-York?"</p>

<p>"I shall be in New-York very soon," he replied; "perhaps
to-morrow&mdash;but we move there in such different spheres, Lilian,
that I do not know when we shall meet."</p>

<p>"Perhaps never," said Lilian, endeavoring, not very successfully,
to steady her voice and speak with <i>nonchalance</i>, "unless
you are willing to leave what you call your sphere and seek
me in mine."</p>

<p>"I only need your permission to do so with delight,"&mdash;and
so charming had her evident emotion made her in his eyes,
that Michael could not refrain from pressing her hand to his
lips. There was no anger in the flush which this action brought
to Lilian's cheek.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_183' id='Page_183' title='183'>&nbsp;</a>Mr. Trevanion was punctual to the hour of his appointment,
and descended from his carriage only to hand Lilian into it.</p>

<p>"You will call sometimes to see how your ward does," he
said good-humoredly to the elder Mr. Grahame, but to Michael
not a word. He had determined to discourage, and, if possible,
completely to overthrow any intimacy which Mr. Grahame had
acknowledged to him was not unattended with danger. Mr.
Trevanion was a man of liberal mind, yet he was not wholly
free from the prejudices of his class, which made the highest
happiness the result of the highest social position. There is in
the mind of man so unconquerable a desire for the unattainable,
that it is not wonderful perhaps that this opinion should be entertained
by those who do not occupy that position; but to
those who do, we should suppose its fallacy would stand out too
glaringly to be doubted or denied. We are far from denying
the advantages of rank and wealth: but we view them not as
an end, but as a means for the attainment of an end, and that
end, not happiness, except as happiness is indissolubly connected
with the perfection of our own powers, and with the extension
of our usefulness to others. He who, like Michael Grahame,
can command the means of intellectual cultivation and refinement,
and a fair arena for the exercise of his powers, when thus
cultivated, need not envy the possessor of larger fortune and
higher station with his weightier responsibilities and greater
temptations.</p>

<p>Michael Grahame understood Mr. Trevanion's coolness, but
he was not one to retreat from an unfought field. Three days
had scarcely given to Lilian the feeling of ease in her new home,
when he called on her. He had chosen morning, as the hour
when others would be the least likely to dispute her attention with
him. She was at home&mdash;Mrs. and Miss Trevanion were out&mdash;and
a long <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> almost reconciled him to her new abode.
He had not forgotten his father's advice, nor taken the seal from<a class='page' name ='Page_184' id='Page_184' title='184'>&nbsp;</a>
his lips. He might not speak to her of love, but the nicest
honor did not forbid him to show her the true sympathy and
affection of a friend. In a few days he called again, and at the
same hour; Miss Devoe was not at home, she had gone out
with Mrs. and Miss Trevanion. Again the next day he came
at the same hour, and the answer was the same. He called
in the afternoon at five o'clock, and she was at dinner; at seven
o'clock, she was preparing for an evening party, and begged he
would excuse her. "I will seek no more," said Michael Grahame
at length, with proud determination, "to enter the charmed
circle which shuts her from me in the city. They cannot
keep her to themselves always, and if Lilian's heart be what I
deem it, it will take more than a few months of absence to efface
from it the memories of years."</p>

<p>A few days only after this determination, Lilian was called
down at nine o'clock in the morning, to see Mr. Grahame.
Early as it was, the furtive glance towards her mirror and the
hasty adjustment of her ringlets, might have suggested to an
observer, that she hoped to receive in her visitor one who had
an eye for beauty; and the sudden change that passed over her
countenance as she entered the parlor in which her two guardians
sat in earnest talk, would have awakened strong suspicions
that she did not see <i>the Mr. Grahame</i> whom she had
expected. Mr. Trevanion rose as she entered, and shaking
hands with Mr. Grahame, said kindly, "I leave you with Lilian,
Mr. Grahame, but I hope to see you again at dinner&mdash;we dine
at five."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir, but I hope to be taking tea with my good
woman at home at that hour."</p>

<p>"Well, I shall hope to see you again soon&mdash;you must call
often and see your friend Lilian."</p>

<p>"Why, I've been thinking, sir, that that would hardly be best
for any of us&mdash;and to tell the truth, I came to-day to talk with<a class='page' name ='Page_185' id='Page_185' title='185'>&nbsp;</a>
Lilian about that very thing, and if you please, I have no objection
that you should hear what I have to say."</p>

<p>Mr. Trevanion seated himself again, and Lilian placing
herself on the sofa beside him, Mr. Grahame resumed:&mdash;"It
seems to me, sir, that Lilian has to choose between two kinds
of life, which, should she try to put them together will only
spoil one another, and I want her to have a fair chance to judge
between them. Now, you know, sir, I speak the truth when I
say that there are many among the fine gay people whom Lilian
will meet at your house, who would look down upon her for
having such friends as I and my wife, or even my son, though
President B&mdash;&mdash; says he will be a distinguished man yet."</p>

<p>"I do not care for such people, or for what they think,"
exclaimed Lilian indignantly.</p>

<p>"I dare say not, my dear child, and yet they are people who
are thought a great deal of, and whom, if you are to live
amongst them, it would be worth your while to please&mdash;but
that isn't my main point, Lilian. What I want to say, though
I seem to be long coming at it, is, that I want you to see this
gay life that fine folks in the city lead, at its best&mdash;without any
such drawbacks as it would have for you, if you were suspected
of having ungenteel acquaintances, and so we shall none of us
come to see you&mdash;barring you should be sick, or something
else happen to make you want us&mdash;until you make a fair trial,
for six months at least, of this life&mdash;then should the beautiful,
rich Miss Devoe like the old gardener and his family well enough
to come and see them, she will learn how fondly and truly they
love their Lilian."</p>

<p>"I had hoped you loved her too well to give her up so
needlessly for six months, or even for one month," said Lilian,
tears rushing to her eyes.</p>

<p>"Ask Mr. Trevanion if I am not right in what I have said,
my dear child," said Mr. Grahame tenderly.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_186' id='Page_186' title='186'>&nbsp;</a>"I will not dispute the correctness of your principles in the
main, Mr. Grahame, but I hope you do not think that all Lilian's
<i>fine</i> acquaintances as you call them, would be so unjust in their
judgment as to think the less of her for her love of you, or to
undervalue you on account of your position in life."</p>

<p>"No sir&mdash;no sir&mdash;I don't think so of all&mdash;but I want Lilian
to see this life without even one little cloud upon it&mdash;such a
cloud as the being looked down upon, though it were by people
she didn't greatly admire, would make. We have our pride
too, sir, and we want Lilian to try for herself whether our friendship,
with all its good and its bad, be worth keeping. She is
too good and affectionate, we know, to shake off old friends
that love her, even if they become troublesome&mdash;but we will
draw ourselves off, and then she will be free to come back to
us or not, as she pleases. Now, sir, tell me frankly, if you think
me wrong."</p>

<p>"Not wrong in principle, as I said before, Mr. Grahame, but&mdash;excuse
me&mdash;you required me to be frank&mdash;would it not have
been better to have made this withdrawal gradually and quietly,
in such a manner that Lilian would not have noticed it, instead
of giving her the pain of this abrupt severance of the ties between
you?"</p>

<p>"A great deal better, sir," said Mr. Grahame, coloring with
wonderful feeling, and fixing his clear, keen eye full on Mr.
Trevanion,&mdash;"a great deal better if I wished to sever those ties&mdash;a
great deal better if I would have Lilian believe that we had
grown cold and indifferent to her. But, my dear child," and
he turned to her, and taking both her hands, spoke very earnestly&mdash;"believe
me, when I tell you, that you will find few
among those who see you every day, that love you so warmly
as the friends who have loved you from your birth, and who
now stand away from you only because they will not be in the
way of what the world considers higher fortunes for you if you<a class='page' name ='Page_187' id='Page_187' title='187'>&nbsp;</a>
desire them. To leave you free to choose for yourself, is the
strongest proof of love we could give you, and I repeat, when
you have tried all that this new life has to give you&mdash;tried it
for six months&mdash;if your heart still turns with its old love to
those early friends, you will give them joy indeed."</p>

<p>Mr. Grahame paused, but neither Mr. Trevanion nor Lilian
attempted to reply to him for some minutes&mdash;at length she
raised her eyes, and said,</p>

<p>"You did not think of this when I left you&mdash;what has
changed your mind&mdash;I will not say your <i>heart</i>&mdash;towards me?"</p>

<p>"You are right not to say our hearts, Lilian; but, indeed,
even my mind has not been changed&mdash;I thought then as I
think now&mdash;but I could not persuade others of our family to
think with me. Now, however, they all feel that they cannot
keep up their old friendly intercourse with you without mortification
to themselves, and pain to you. And, as I said before,
we were none of us willing to withdraw from that intercourse
without giving you our reasons for it, lest you should think we
had grown indifferent to you."</p>

<p>Mr. Grahame soon departed, leaving Lilian saddened and
Mr. Trevanion perplexed by his visit. "Singular old man!"
this gentleman exclaimed to himself more than once, in reflecting
on all that Mr. Grahame had said; so difficult is it for those
whose minds have been forced into the strait forms of conventionalism
to comprehend the dictates of untrammelled common
sense, on points which that conventionalism undertakes to
control. One thing at least Mr. Trevanion did comprehend&mdash;that
on the succeeding six months depended Lilian's choice of
her position and associates for life.</p>

<p>"So far Mr. Grahame is right Lilian," he said to her, "you
cannot have a place at once in two such different spheres as his
and ours. I always knew that to be impossible."</p>

<p>"You called my father friend," said Lilian, with unusual
boldness.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_188' id='Page_188' title='188'>&nbsp;</a>"Your father was a gentleman by birth and breeding."</p>

<p>"And he has told me," persisted Lilian, "that he has never
known more true refinement and even nobility of mind than in
Mr. Grahame."</p>

<p>"I agree with him&mdash;of <i>mind</i>, mark&mdash;but there is a want of
conventional refinement which would make itself felt in society."</p>

<p>"There is no want even of this in his son," said Lilian with
a trembling voice, and turning away to hide the blush that
burned upon her cheek.</p>

<p>"Probably not, for Michael Grahame has been for years at
the best schools, with the sons of our first families&mdash;but we cannot
separate him from his father, and from the associates which
his trade has given him."</p>

<p>Neither Mr. Trevanion nor Lilian ever spoke on this subject
again; but the former resolved that no effort should be lost on
his part to restore one so beautiful and so accomplished as his
young ward to what he considered her true place in society,
and the latter was as firmly determined that nothing should
make her forgetful of the friends of her childhood. In furtherance
of this resolve, Mr. Trevanion, instead of retiring to his
country-seat with his family on the approach of summer, sent
his younger children thither under the care of their faithful and
intelligent nurse; and with Mrs. and Miss Trevanion, and
Lilian, set out for Saratoga, at that season the great focus of
fashion. Mrs. Trevanion, entering fully into his designs, had
attended to Lilian's equipments for this important campaign,
with no less care than to Anna's, and the result equalled their
fondest expectations. Lilian was <i>the beauty</i>, <i>the heiress</i>, the
belle of the season. Report exaggerated her fortune, appended
all sorts of romantic incidents to her history and her connection
with the Trevanions, and thus increased the interest which her
own beauty and modest elegance was calculated to awaken.<a class='page' name ='Page_189' id='Page_189' title='189'>&nbsp;</a>
Admirers crowded around her, and to render her triumph complete,
one who had hitherto found no charms in America
worthy his homage, bowed at her shrine. This was Mr.
Derwent, an Englishman of high birth and large fortune, whose
elegant exterior, and the perfect <i>savoir faire</i> which marked his
manners, made him at Saratoga,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"The observed of all observers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glass of fashion and the mould of form."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Trevanion looked on with scarcely concealed delight.</p>

<p>"Why, father! do you wish to see Lilian leave us for England?"
cried Anna Trevanion, to whom he had expressed his
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my daughter, if only in that way I can see her
take that position which is hers by inheritance, and from which
only her father's misfortunes have estranged her."</p>

<p>But Mr. Trevanion's hopes of so desirable a termination of
his cares for Lilian faded, as he saw the reserve with which she
met the attentions of her admirers&mdash;not excepting even the
admired Mr. Derwent.</p>

<p>"Among the beauties at this place, Miss L&mdash;&mdash; D&mdash;&mdash;, the
ward of Mr. T&mdash;&mdash;, stands unrivalled. She is an heiress as
well as a beauty, but the report is that both the fortune and
the beauty are to be borne to another land, in the possession of
the Honorable Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;, whose personal qualities, united to
his station and fortune, render him, in the opinion of the ladies
at least, irresistible."</p>

<p>Such was the paragraph in a New-York daily paper, which
Mr. Trevanion one morning handed to Lilian with a smile.
She read it silence, and laid it down without a comment, except
that which was furnished by the proud erection of her
figure, and the almost scornful curl of her lip.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_190' id='Page_190' title='190'>&nbsp;</a>When next she met Mr. Derwent, Mr. Trevanion's eye was
on her, for he thought, "She cannot preserve her perfect indifference
of manner with the consciousness that their names
have been thus associated." He was mistaken. The color on
Lilian's cheek deepened not at Mr. Derwent's approach, nor did
her hand tremble as she laid it upon the arm he offered in attending
her to dinner. "Her heart must be already occupied,"
said Mr. Trevanion to himself, and perhaps he was right in believing
that nothing but a deep and true affection&mdash;one which
was founded on no adventitious circumstances, but on the immovable
basis of esteem&mdash;could have enabled her to resist the
blandishments which surrounded her in her present position.
But she did resist them, and still, from the luxurious elegancies,
the gay entertainments and the flatteries of fashionable
life, her heart turned with undiminished tenderness to the tranquil
shades of Mossgiel, and still paid there its willing homage
to the loftiest intellect and the noblest heart, in her estimation,
with which earth was blessed.</p>

<p>September, with its cool, invigorating freshness, had come,
when Mr. Trevanion's family returned to the city. To Lilian's
great, though unspoken disappointment, the children met them
there, and no thought seemed to be entertained of a visit to the
country. Carefully she had kept the date of Mr. Grahame's
conversation, in which he had demanded that she should make
a six months' trial of life, freed from the associations which her
early poverty had fastened on her. In a few weeks after her
return to New-York, the six months were completed. On the
day preceding its exact completion, Lilian expressed to Mr.
Trevanion her wish to visit Mossgiel. "It is now six months,"
she said with a blush and a smile, "since I saw Mr. Grahame."</p>

<p>Whatever might have been Mr. Trevanion's wishes for his
ward, he had neither the right nor the will to control her
actions, and he not only consented to her going, but went down<a class='page' name ='Page_191' id='Page_191' title='191'>&nbsp;</a>
with her himself to Trevanion Hall, where they arrived late in
the evening.</p>

<p>Lilian knew that the inhabitants of Mossgiel kept early
hours, and the gay pink and blue and white convolvuluses,
which arched the rude gate leading from the more public road
into the rural lane by which their house was approached, had
just unfolded their petals, when she rode through it on the
morning succeeding her arrival at Trevanion Hall. She had
declined the attendance of a servant, and set off at a brisk
canter, but soon reined in her horse and proceeded at a slower
pace. Hope and fear were busy at her heart. Six months!
What changes might not have taken place in that time! Again
Lilian touched her horse with her light riding-whip, and rode
briskly on till she reached the gate of which we have spoken.
Here she alighted to open the gate. As she entered the lane
she saw, not far in advance of her, a boy who had been hired to
assist Mr. Grahame in the garden. She called to him, and
giving him her bridle to lead her horse to the stable, walked
on herself towards the house, which was little more than a
hundred yards distant. After walking a few steps, she turned
to ask, "Are Mr. and Mrs. Grahame well?"</p>

<p>Another question trembled on her lips&mdash;but she could not
speak it. "If <i>he</i> love me, he will be here," she whispered to
herself, and again passed on. The road wound around the
house, and led to the entrance on the river front. There was a
side gate leading to the garden, and there, at that hour, Lilian
knew she would most probably meet the elder Mr. Grahame,
while his wife was almost certain to be found in the dairy, to
which the same gate would give her access; but the gate was
passed with a light, quick step, and Lilian entered the house at
the front. With a fluttering heart, but a steady purpose, she
passed on, without meeting any one, or hearing a sound, to the
usual morning room. The door was open; she entered, and<a class='page' name ='Page_192' id='Page_192' title='192'>&nbsp;</a>
her heart throbbed exultingly, for <i>he</i> was there. Michael Grahame
sat at a table writing. His back was towards the door,
and her light step had given no notice of her presence. Agitated
by a thousand commingled emotions, wishing, yet dreading to
meet his eye, she stood gazing on his face as it was reflected in
an opposite mirror. It seemed to her paler and graver than of
yore. Manhood had stamped its lines more deeply on the brow
since last they parted. But some movement, a sigh, perhaps,
from her, has startled him. He raises his head, and in the
mirror their eyes meet. In that glance her whole soul has
been revealed, and with one glad cry of "Lilian! my Lilian!"
he turns, and she is folded in his arms.</p>

<p>There was no more doubt, no more fear, on her part&mdash;no
concealment on his. She had chosen freely and nobly, and she
was rewarded by love as deep, as devoted, and as unselfish as
ever woman inspired, or man felt.</p>

<p>The marriage of Lilian, which took place in three months
after her return to Mossgiel, could not but excite some interest
in the world in which she had so lately occupied a conspicuous
place. When, however, to the great question&mdash;"Who is this
Mr. Grahame?" the answer, "Nothing but a mechanic," was
received&mdash;the interest soon faded away, and in the winter Lilian
found herself in New-York, with scarcely an acquaintance,
except the Trevanions, and she could easily perceive that something
of pity was mingled with their former kindness. Yet
never had Lilian been less an object of pity. Every day increased
not only her affection to her husband, but her pride in
him, by revealing to her more of his high powers and noble
qualities. Those powers had received a new spring from his
desire to prove himself worthy of his cherished wife. He had
long been occupied with a problem whose solution, he believed,
would enable him to increase greatly both the speed and safety
of steam navigation. In the early part of the winter succeeding<a class='page' name ='Page_193' id='Page_193' title='193'>&nbsp;</a>
his marriage, with a glad spirit, with which Lilian fully sympathized,
he cried "Eureka." Before the winter concluded he had
been to Washington, and explaining to the officers of our own
government the importance of his invention, sought permission
to test it on a government vessel. After many delays, with that
short-sighted policy which cannot look beyond the present expense
to the overpaying results, the proposition was declined.
During his stay in Washington, his object had become noised
abroad, and the Russian Minister had opened a correspondence
with him and with his own court on the subject. The result of
this correspondence was, that in the following spring Michael
Grahame sailed for Russia, to test his invention first in the
service of its emperor. He was accompanied by Lilian. Their
departure and its object were talked of for awhile, but soon
ceased to be remembered, except by men of science, and those
immediately interested in the result of his experiment.</p>

<p>In the mean time Anna Trevanion married. Her husband,
Mr. Walker, was a man of large property, and of social position
equal to her own. They spent the first two years of their married
life abroad. It was in the second of these two years, and
when Lilian had been four years in St. Petersburgh, that Mr.
and Mrs. Walker entered that city. One of their first inquiries
of the American Minister was, "What Americans are here?"
and at the head of the list he presented, stood Mr. and Mrs.
Grahame. "And who are Mr. and Mrs. Grahame?" asked Mr.
Walker. "You say they are from New-York, and I remember
no such names of any consequence in society there."</p>

<p>"I do not know what their consequence was there, but I
assure you it is as great here as the partiality of the Emperor,
the favor of the Imperial family, and their association with the
highest rank, can make it."</p>

<p>"But how did people unknown at home work themselves
into such a position?"</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_194' id='Page_194' title='194'>&nbsp;</a>"They did not work themselves into it all&mdash;they took it at
once, by the only right which Americans have to any position
abroad&mdash;the right of their own fitness for it. Mr. Grahame,
besides his high attainments in science, and his skill in mechanics,
which first introduced him to the Emperor, is a man of
fine appearance, of very extensive information, and very agreeable
manners, and Mrs. Grahame is one of the most beautiful
and cultivated women I know. I repeat, you cannot enter
society here under better auspices than theirs."</p>

<p>And thus the long-severed friends met in reversed positions;
and if something of triumph did flash from Lilian's eyes, as she
saw her husband, day after day, procuring from the Emperor's
favor, privileges for Mr. and Mrs. Walker, not often enjoyed by
strangers, her triumph was for him, and may be excused.</p>

<p>After eight years spent in Russia, during which he had acquired
fortune as well as fame, Michael Grahame returned to
America, with his wife and three lovely children, and retired to
a beautiful country seat within a mile of Mossgiel, purchased
and furnished for him during his absence. His father still
cultivates his garden, though he has ceased to sell its produce,
and through those flowery walks Lilian and her husband still
delight to wander, recalling the happy memories with which
they are linked, with grateful and adoring hearts.</p>

<p>"I shall never object again to any woman in whom I am
interested, marrying the man of her choice, because he is only
a mechanic," said Mrs. Trevanion to her husband, as they were
returning one day from a visit to Mr. and Mrs. Grahame.</p>

<p>"There, my dear, in those words, <i>only a mechanic</i>, lies our
mistake, the world's mistake, in such matters. No man is <i>only</i>
what his trade, his profession, or his position in life makes him.
Every man is something besides this, something by force of his
own inherent personal qualities. By these the true man is
formed, and by these he should be judged."</p>

<p>Again we were all assembled in the parlor in which so many
of our cheerful evenings had been spent, but a shadow seemed to
have fallen on our little circle. The New-Year was now close
in its approach, and immediately after the commencement of
the New-Year we must separate. Mr. and Mrs. Dudley, with
their children, and Mr. and Mrs. Seagrove, with theirs, and
Mr. Arlington and I, must all leave within a day or two
of each other, and a year, with all its chances and changes, will
probably intervene before we meet again. The very thought,
as I have said, threw a shadow upon us; but Col. Donaldson,
who is a most inveterate foe to sadness, would not suffer us to
yield unresistingly to its influence. If our time was short, the
greater the necessity for crowding enjoyment into its every
moment, he said: we could spare none of it for lamentations.</p>

<p>"Now, Aunt Nancy," he continued, "if I am not mistaken,
you can match Mr. Arlington's story with one quite as romantic,
of an extraordinary marriage in high life. Do you remember
Lady Houstoun and her son Edward Houstoun&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" I cried, interrupting him, "and the beautiful
Lucy Watson too."</p>

<p>"Then I am sure you must have their story somewhere in
your bundle of romances."</p>

<p>"I believe I have," I replied, as opening my desk I drew<a class='page' name ='Page_196' id='Page_196' title='196'>&nbsp;</a>
out package after package, the amusement of many an hour,
which but for such a resource might have been sad in its loneliness.
Some were looking fresh and new, and others yellow

<p>A proud and stately dame was Lady Houstoun, as she continued
to be called after the independence of America had
rendered such titles valueless in our land. Sir Edward Houstoun
was an English baronet, whose estates had once been a fit
support to his ancient title, but whose family had suffered
deeply, both in purse and person, by their loyalty to Charles
the First, and yet more by their obstinate adherence to his bigot
son, James II. By a marriage with Louisa Vivian, an American
heiress possessed of broad lands and a large amount of ready
money, Sir Edward acquired the power of supporting his rank
with all the splendor that had belonged to his family in the
olden time; but circumstances connected with the poverty of
his early years had given the young baronet a disgust to his
own circle, which was not alleviated by the rapid changes
effected by his newly-acquired wealth, and he preferred returning
to America with his young bride, and adopting her country
as his own. Here wealth sufficient for their most extravagant
desires was theirs&mdash;houses in New-York, and fertile acres
stretching far away from the city, now sweeping for many a
rood the banks of the fair Hudson, and now reaching back into
the rich lands that lie east of that river. When the separation
of this country from England came, the representative of her
most loyal family, whose motto was "<i>Dieu et mon Roi</i>" was
found in the ranks of republican America. "He could not,"<a class='page' name ='Page_197' id='Page_197' title='197'>&nbsp;</a>
he said, "recognize a divine right in the House of Hanover to
the throne of the Stuarts, or justify by any human reason the
blind subservience of Americans to the ruinous enactments of
an English parliament, controlled by a rash and headstrong
minister and a wayward king." Ten years after the proclamation
of peace Sir Edward died, leaving one son who had just
entered his twentieth year.</p>

<p>Young as Edward Houstoun was, he had a man's decision of
character; and when the question of his assuming his father's
title, and claiming the estates attached to it in England, was submitted
to him, he replied that "his proudest title was that of
an American citizen, and he would not forfeit that title to
become a royal duke." He could therefore inherit only his
father's personal property, consisting principally of plate, jewels
and paintings. The property thus received was all which the
young Edward Houstoun could call his own. All else was his
mother's, and though it would doubtless be his at her death,
the Lady Houstoun was not one to relinquish the reins of
government before that inevitable hour should wrest them from
her hand. She made her son a very handsome allowance,
however, and, with a higher degree of generosity than any
pecuniary grant could evince, she never attempted to control
his actions, suffering him to enjoy his sports in the country and
amusements in the city without constraint. The Lady Houstoun
was a wise woman, as well as an affectionate mother. She saw
well that her son's independent and proud nature might be
attracted by kindness to move whither she would, while the
very appearance of constraint would drive him in an opposite
direction. On one subject he greatly tried her forbearance&mdash;the
unbecoming levity, as she esteemed it, with which he regarded
the big-wigged gentlemen and hooped and farthingaled
ladies whose portraits ornamented their picture gallery. For
only one of these did Edward profess the slightest consideration.<a class='page' name ='Page_198' id='Page_198' title='198'>&nbsp;</a>
This was that of the simple soldier whose gallantry under
William the Conqueror had laid the foundation of his family
fortunes and honors.</p>

<p>"Dear mother," said he one day,  "what proof have we that
those other fine gentlemen and ladies deserved the wealth and
station which, through his noble qualities, they obtained?"</p>

<p>"Sir James Houstoun, my son, who devoted life and fortune
to his king&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, noble Sir James," interrupted Edward,
bowing low and with mock gravity to the portrait, "I will
place you and your stern-looking son there at your side next
in my veneration to our first ancestor. Yet you showed that,
like me, you had little value for wealth or station."</p>

<p>"Edward!" ejaculated Lady Houstoun, in an accent of displeasure,
"that we are willing to sacrifice a possession at the
call of duty does not prove us insensible of its value."</p>

<p>"Nay, mother mine, speak not so gravely, but acknowledge
that you would be prouder of your boy if you saw him by his
own energies winning his way to distinction from earth's
lowliest station, than you can be of him now&mdash;idler as he is."</p>

<p>"There is no less merit, Edward, in using aright the gifts
which we inherit, than in acquiring them. There is as much
energy, I can assure you, demanded in the proper management
of large estates, and the right direction of the influence derived
from station&mdash;ay, often more energy, the exercise of higher
powers, than those by which a fortunate soldier, in time of war,
may often spring in a day from nameless poverty to wealth and
rank."</p>

<p>The Lady Houstoun's still fine figure was elevated to its
utmost height as she spoke, and her dark eye flashed out from
beneath the shadow of the deep borders of her widow's cap.
A stranger would have gazed on her with admiration, but her
son turned away with a slight shrug of the shoulders and a<a class='page' name ='Page_199' id='Page_199' title='199'>&nbsp;</a>
curling lip, as he said to himself, "My mother may feel all this,
for she manages the estates, and she bestows the influence&mdash;while
I <i>amuse myself</i>. Mother," he added aloud, "they say
there is fine sport in the neighborhood of the Glen, and I should
like to see the place. I will take a party thither next week, if
you will write to your farmer to prepare the house for us."</p>

<p>"I will, Edward, certainly, if you desire it, but it has been
so long since any of us were there, that I fear you will find
the house very uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"So much the better, if it give us a little variety in our
smooth lives. I dare say we shall all like it very much. I
shall, at least, and if the rest do not, they can return."</p>

<p>The Glen was a wild rural spot among the Highlands,
where Sir Edward had delighted occasionally to spend a few
weeks with his wife and child and one or two chosen friends, in
the enjoyment of country sports. For several years before his
father's death, Edward had been too much engaged in his
collegiate studies to share these visits. During the three years
which had passed since that event, neither Lady Houstoun nor
her son had visited the Glen, and it was not without emotion
that she heard him name his intention of taking a party thither;
but she offered no opposition to the plan, and in a little more
than a week he was established in the comfortable dwelling-house
there, with Walter Osgood; Philip Van Schaick, and
Peter Schuyler, companions who were soon persuaded to leave
the somewhat formal circles of the city for a few days of
adventure in the country. They had arrived late in the night,
and wearied by fifteen hours' confinement on board a small
sloop, the visitors slept late the next morning, while Edward
Houstoun, haunted by tender memories, was early awake and
abroad. Standing in the porch, he looked forth through the
gray light of the early dawn on hill and dale and river,
endeavoring to recall the feelings with which he had gazed on<a class='page' name ='Page_200' id='Page_200' title='200'>&nbsp;</a>
them seven years before. Then he was a boy of scarcely
sixteen, eager only for the holiday sport or the distinction of
the school-room&mdash;now, he stood there&mdash;a boy still, his heart
indignantly pronounced, though he had numbered nearly
twenty-three years. Edward Houstoun was beginning to wake
to somewhat of noble scorn in viewing his own position&mdash;beginning
to feel that to amuse himself was an object hardly
worthy a <i>man's</i> life. Turning forcibly from such thoughts, he
sprang down the steps, and pursued a path leading by the
orchard and through a flowery lane, towards the dwelling of
the farmer to whom the management of the Glen had been intrusted,
first by Sir Edward and afterwards by Lady Houstoun.
The sun was just touching with a sapphire tint the few clouds
that specked the eastern sky; the branches of the wild rose
and mountain laurel which skirted the lane on the right were
heavy with the dews of night, and the birds seemed caroling
their earliest song in the orchard and clover-field on the left,
yet the farmer's horses were already harnessed to the wagon,
and through the open door of the house Edward Houstoun as he
approached caught a glimpse of Farmer Pye himself and his
men seated at breakfast. As he was not perceived by them,
he passed on, without interrupting them, to the dairy, where
the good dame was busy with her white pails and bright pans.
A calico bonnet with a very deep front concealed his approach
from Mrs. Pye until he stood beside her; but there was one
within the dairy who saw him, and whose coquettish movement
in snatching from her glossy brown ringlets a bonnet of the
same unbecoming shape with that of Mrs. Pye, did not escape
his observation.</p>

<p>"Well, now&mdash;did I ever see the like! Why, Mr. Edward,
you've grown clean out of a body's memory&mdash;but after all, nobody
couldn't help knowing you that ever seen your papa, good
gentleman&mdash;how much you are like him!"</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_201' id='Page_201' title='201'>&nbsp;</a>Thus ran on Dame Pye, while Edward, except when compelled
by a question to attend to her, was wondering who the
fair girl could be, who was separated from her companion not
less by the tasteful arrangement of her dress&mdash;simple and even
coarse as it was in its material&mdash;and by a certain grace of movement,
than by her delicate beauty. Her form was slender in
proportion to its height, yet gave in its graceful outline promise
of a development "rich in all woman's loveliness;" and her face,
with its dark starry eyes, its clear, transparent skin, and rich,
waving curls of glossy brown, recalled so vividly to Edward
Houstoun's memory his favorite description of beauty, that he
repeated almost audibly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"One shade the more, one ray the less,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had half impair'd the nameless grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That waves in every glossy tress,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or softly lightens o'er her face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where thoughts serenely sweet express<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How pure, how dear their dwelling-place."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His admiration, if not audible, was sufficiently evident to
its object&mdash;at least so we interpret her tremulous and uncertain
movements, the eloquent blood which glowed in her cheeks,
and the mistakes which at length aroused Mrs. Pye's attention.</p>

<p>"Why, Lucy! what under the sun and earth's the matter
with you, child?  Dear&mdash;dear&mdash;to go putting the cream into
the new milk, instead of emptying it into the churn! There&mdash;there&mdash;child&mdash;better
go in now&mdash;I'll finish&mdash;and just tell Mr.
Pye that Mr. Edward is here," said Mrs. Pye, fearful of some
new accident.</p>

<p>The discarded bonnet was put on with a heightened color,
and the young girl moved rapidly yet gracefully toward the
house.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_202' id='Page_202' title='202'>&nbsp;</a>"I did not remember you had a daughter, Mrs. Pye," said
Edward Houstoun, as she disappeared.</p>

<p>"And I haven't a daughter&mdash;only the two boys, Sammy
and Isaac&mdash;good big boys they are now, and help their father
quite some&mdash;but this girl's none of mine, though I'm sure I love
her 'most as well&mdash;she's so pretty and nice, and has such handy
ways, though what could have tempted her to put the cream
in the new milk just now, I'm sure I can't tell."</p>

<p>"But who is she, Mrs. Pye?"</p>

<p>"Who is she? Why, sure, and did you never hear of Lucy
Watson? Oh! here's Mr. Pye."</p>

<p>Edward Houstoun was too much interested in learning something
more of Lucy Watson, not to find a sufficient reason for
lingering behind the farmer, who was impatient to be in his
hay-field. Mrs. Pye was communicative, and he soon learned
all she knew&mdash;that Lucy was the daughter of a soldier belonging
to a company commanded by Sir Edward Houstoun during
the war&mdash;that this soldier had received his death-wound in defending
his commander from a sword-cut, and that Sir Edward
had always considered his widow and only child as his especial
charge. The widow had soon followed her husband to the
grave, and the child had been placed by Sir Edward with the
wife of a country clergyman. To Mr. and Mrs. Merton, Lucy
had been as an own and only daughter.</p>

<p>"The good old people made quite a lady of her," said Mrs.
Pye. "She can read and write equal to the parson himself,
and I've hearn folks say that her 'broidery and music playin'
was better than Mrs. Merton's own; but, poor thing! Mrs.
Merton died, and still the parson begged Sir Edward to let her
stay with him&mdash;she was all that was left now, he said&mdash;so Sir
Edward let her stay. Mr. Merton died a year ago, and when
Mr. Pye wrote to the lady&mdash;that's your mother, Mr. Edward&mdash;about
her, she said she'd better come here and stay with us, and<a class='page' name ='Page_203' id='Page_203' title='203'>&nbsp;</a>
she would pay her board, and give her money for clothes, and
five thousand dollars beside, whenever she should get married.
I'm sure she's welcome to stay, if it was without pay,
for we all love her, but, somehow, it don't seem the right place
for her&mdash;and, as to marrying, I don't think she'll ever marry
any body around her, for, kind-spoken as she is, they wouldn't
any of them dare to ask her, though they're all in love with her
beautiful face."</p>

<p>In a week Edward Houstoun's friends had grown weary of
ruralizing&mdash;they found no longer any music in the crack of a
fowling-piece, or any enjoyment in the dying agonies of the
feathered tribes, and, having resisted all their persuasions to return
with them, he was left alone.</p>

<p>"I shall report you as love-sick, or brain-sick, reclining by
purling streams, under shady groves, to read Shakspeare, or
Milton, or Spenser, for each of these books I have seen you at
different times put in your pocket, and wander forth with a
most sentimental air&mdash;doubtless to make love to some Nymph
or Dryad."</p>

<p>"Make love! Ah! there, I take it, you have winged the
right bird, Van Schaick."</p>

<p>"If I had seen a decent petticoat since we took leave of
Mynheer Van Winkle and his daughter, on board the good
sloop St. Nicholas, I should think so too, Osgood."</p>

<p>"At any rate, it would be wise to report our suspicions to
his lady mother."</p>

<p>"Your suspicions of what&mdash;lunacy or love?" asked Edward
Houstoun.</p>

<p>"A distinction without a difference&mdash;they are equivalent
terms."</p>

<p>Thus jested his friends, and thus jested Edward Houstoun
with them&mdash;well assured that no gleam of the truth had shined
on them&mdash;that they never supposed his visits at Farmer Pye's<a class='page' name ='Page_204' id='Page_204' title='204'>&nbsp;</a>
possessed any greater attraction than could be derived from the
farmer's details of improvements made at the Glen, of the increased
value of lands, or the proceeds of the last year's crop.
They had never seen Lucy Watson, and how could they suspect
that while the farmer smoked his pipe at the door, and the
good dame bustled about her household concerns, he sat watching
with enamored eyes the changes of a countenance full of
intelligence and sensibility, and listening with charmed ears to
a soft, musical voice recounting, with all the simple eloquence
of genuine feeling, obligations to the father whose memory was
with him almost an idolatry. Still less could they divine that
Shakspeare, and Milton, and Spenser were indeed often read
beside a purling stream, and within the dense shadow of a
grove of oak and chestnut-trees&mdash;not to Nymph or Dryad, but
to a "mortal being of earth's mould,"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A creature not too bright or good<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For human nature's daily food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For simple pleasures, harmless wiles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For love, blame, kisses, tears and smiles."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here, one afternoon, a fortnight after the departure of his
friends, sat Edward Houstoun with Lucy at his side. They had
lingered till the sunlight, which had fallen here and there in
broken and changeful gleams through over-arching boughs,
touching with gold the ripples at their feet, had faded into that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"mellow light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which heaven to gaudy day denies."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Edward Houstoun held a book in his hand, but it had long
been closed, while he was engaged in a far more interesting
study. He had with a delicate tact won his companion to
speak as she had never spoken before of herself&mdash;not of the<a class='page' name ='Page_205' id='Page_205' title='205'>&nbsp;</a>
few events of her short life, for these were already known to
him, but of the influence of those events on feeling and character.
Tenderness looked forth without disguise from the
earnest eyes which were fastened on her, as he said, "You
say, Lucy, that you have found friends every where, have met
only kindness, and yet you weep&mdash;you are sad."</p>

<p>"Do not think me ungrateful," she replied. "I have indeed
found friends and kindness&mdash;but these give exercise only
to my gratitude&mdash;stronger, tenderer affections I have, which no
father, or mother, or brother, or sister, will ever call forth."</p>

<p>"Nay, Lucy, were you not adopted by my father, and am I
not your brother?"</p>

<p>A glance whose brightness melted into tears was her only
answer.</p>

<p>"Fie! fie! tears again? I shall have to scold my sister,"
said Edward Houstoun. "What complaint can you make now
that I have found you a brother?"</p>

<p>Lucy laughed, but soon her face grew grave, and, after a
thoughtful pause, she said, "I believe those cannot be quite
happy who feel that they have nothing to do in the world.
Better be the poorest drudge, with powers fitted to your station,
than to be as I am, an idler&mdash;a mere looker-on at the world."</p>

<p>"Why, Lucy! what else am I?"</p>

<p>"You! You, with fortune to bless, and influence to guide
hundreds! What are you? God's representative to your less
fortunate fellow-creatures&mdash;the steward of his bounty. Oh! be
sure that you use your gifts faithfully."</p>

<p>Lucy spoke solemnly, and it was with no light accent that
Edward Houstoun replied&mdash;"You mistake, Lucy&mdash;you mistake&mdash;I
am in truth no less an idler than yourself&mdash;a looker-on,
with no part in the game of life. To the Lady Houstoun belong
both the fortune and the influence." A mocking smile
had arisen to his lip, but, as he caught her look of surprise, it<a class='page' name ='Page_206' id='Page_206' title='206'>&nbsp;</a>
passed away, leaving a gentle gravity in its place, while he continued&mdash;"Do
not think I mean to complain of my mother,
Lucy. She has been ever affectionate and indulgent to me.
She leaves me no want that she can perceive. My purse is
always full, and my actions unrestrained. I suppose I ought
to be happy."</p>

<p>"And are you not happy?"</p>

<p>"No, Lucy, no! There has long been a vague restlessness
and dissatisfaction about me&mdash;and, now, your words have
thrown light on its cause. I am weary of the perpetual holiday
which life has been to me since I left the walls of a college.
I want to be doing&mdash;I want an object&mdash;something for which
to strive and hope and fear&mdash;what shall it be, Lucy?"</p>

<p>"I have heard Mr. Merton say that no one could choose for
another his aims in life, but were I choosing for myself, it should
be something that would connect me with the minds of others&mdash;something
by which I could do service to their spiritual
beings. Were I a man, I should like to write books&mdash;such
books as would give counsel and comfort to erring and sad
hearts&mdash;"</p>

<p>Edward Houstoun shook his head&mdash;"Even had I an author's
gifts, Lucy, that would not do for me&mdash;I must have action in
my life&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What say you to the pulpit?"</p>

<p>"The noblest of all employments, Lucy&mdash;but it is a heavenly
employment and needs a heavenly spirit. I would not dare to
think of that. Try again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The law? Ah! now I see I have chosen rightly&mdash;you
will be a lawyer&mdash;a great lawyer, like Mr. Patrick Henry."</p>

<p>"You have spoken, Lucy&mdash;and I will do my best to fulfil
your prophecy. I may not be a Patrick Henry&mdash;two such men
belong not to one age&mdash;but I may at least hew out for myself
a place among men, where I may stand with a man's freedom<a class='page' name ='Page_207' id='Page_207' title='207'>&nbsp;</a>
of thought and action. The very decision has emancipated me&mdash;has
emboldened me to speak what a moment since I scarcely
dared to think&mdash;nay, turn not from me, beloved&mdash;oh how passionately
beloved! Life has now its object for me, Lucy&mdash;your
love&mdash;for that I will strive&mdash;hope&mdash;whisper me that I
need not fear&mdash;that when I have a right to claim my bride&mdash;"</p>

<p>When Edward Houstoun commenced this passionate apostrophe,
he had clasped Lucy's hand, and, overcome by his
emotions and her own&mdash;forgetting all but his love&mdash;conscious
only of a bewildering joy&mdash;she had suffered it to rest for one
instant in his clasp. It was but for one instant&mdash;the next, struggling
from him as he strove to retain her, she started to her
feet, and stood leaning against the trunk of the tree that overshadowed
them, with her face hidden by her clasped hands.
He rose and drew near, saying, in low, tremulous tones&mdash;"Lucy,
what means this?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Houstoun," she exclaimed, removing her hands from
her face, and wringing them in passionate sorrow&mdash;"how could
you speak those words?"</p>

<p>"Wherefore should I not speak them&mdash;are they so terrifying
to you, Lucy?"</p>

<p>"Can they be otherwise, since they must separate us for
ever? Think you that the Lady Houstoun would endure that
the creature of her bounty should become the wife of her son?"</p>

<p>"I asked, Lucy, that you would promise to be mine when
I had won a right to act independently of the Lady Houstoun's
opinions."</p>

<p>"Has a son ever a right to act independently of a mother?"</p>

<p>"Is the obedience of a child to be exacted from a man? Is
his happiness ever to be at the mercy of another's prejudices?
Does there never come a period when he may be permitted to
judge for himself?"</p>

<p>Edward Houstoun spoke with indignant emphasis.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_208' id='Page_208' title='208'>&nbsp;</a>"Look not so sternly&mdash;speak not so angrily," exclaimed
Lucy. "I cannot answer your questions&mdash;but my obligations,
at least, are irreversible&mdash;they belong to the irrevocable past,
and while I retain their memory I can never&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush&mdash;hush, Lucy! you will drive me mad. Is my happiness
of less value in your eyes than the few paltry dollars my
mother expended for you?"</p>

<p>"Shall I, serpent-like, sting the hand that has fed me? No!
no! would I had never heard those words. We were so happy&mdash;you
will be happy again&mdash;but I&mdash;leave me, I pray you, for
we must part now and for ever&mdash;oh! leave me."</p>

<p>"No, Lucy, we will never part&mdash;I will never leave you."</p>

<p>He would again have drawn her to his side, but at his touch,
Lucy roused herself, and with a wild, half-frenzied effort, breaking
from him, she rushed rapidly, blindly forward. He would
have followed her, but stumbling against the root of a tree,
before he could recover himself she was at the outskirts of the
wood, in sight of the farm-house, and though he might overtake
he could not detain her. He returned home, not overwhelmed
with disappointment, but with joy throbbing at his heart, and
hope beaming in his eyes. Lucy loved him&mdash;of that he felt
assured&mdash;and bucklered by that assurance he could stand
against the world. Life was before him&mdash;a life not of sickly
pleasures and <i>ennui</i> breeding indolence&mdash;but a life of contest
and struggle and labor, perhaps even of exhausting labor, yet
a life which should awaken and discipline his powers: a life of
victory and of repose&mdash;sweet because won with effort&mdash;a life
to which Lucy's love should give its crowning joy. Such are
youth's dreams. In his case these dreams were somewhat
rudely dispelled by a summons from his mother's physician.
Lady Houstoun was ill&mdash;very ill&mdash;he must not delay, said the
physician; and he did not; yet a hastily pencilled line told that
even at this moment Lucy was not forgotten&mdash;it was a farewell
which breathed love and faith and hope.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_209' id='Page_209' title='209'>&nbsp;</a>On Edward Houstoun's arrival in New-York, he found his
mother already recovering from the acute attack which had
endangered her life and occasioned his recall. He soon unfolded
to her his new views of life, and the career which he had
marked out for himself. New views indeed&mdash;new and incomprehensible
to Lady Houstoun! She saw not that the life of
indulgence, the perpetual gala-day, which she anticipated for
her son, would have condemned him to see his highest powers
dwindle away and die in the lethargy of inaction, or to waste
in repinings against fate those energies given to command
success. Time moderated her astonishment, and quiet perseverance
subdued her opposition&mdash;subdued it the more readily,
perhaps, from the knowledge that her son could accomplish
his designs without her aid, by turning into money the plate,
jewels and pictures received from his father. Edward Houstoun's
first act, after securing the execution of his designs, was
to inform Lucy of the progress he had made. His own absence
from New-York at this time would have excited his
mother's surprise, and might have aroused her suspicions; but
the haste with which he had left the Glen furnished him with a
plausible excuse for sending his own man to look after clothing,
books, &amp;c., that had been forgotten, and by him a letter could,
he knew, be safely sent.</p>

<p>A few days brought back to him his own letter, with the
intelligence that Lucy had left Farmer Pye's family. Whither
she had gone, they could not, or would not tell. Setting all
fears at defiance, he went himself to the Glen&mdash;he sounded and
examined and cross-examined every member of the farmer's
family; but in vain were his efforts. He learned only that she
had declared her intention of supporting herself by her own exertions,
instead of continuing dependent on the Lady Houstoun&mdash;that
she had returned the lady's last donation, through the
farmer, with many expressions of gratitude, and that she had<a class='page' name ='Page_210' id='Page_210' title='210'>&nbsp;</a>
left home for the house of an acquaintance in New-York, from
whom she hoped to receive advice and assistance in the accomplishment
of her intentions. She had mentioned neither the
name nor place of residence of this friend, and though she had
written once to the good farmer, she had only informed him
that she had found a home and employment, without reference
to any person or place. Edward asked to see the letter&mdash;it
was brought, but the post-mark told no secret&mdash;it was that of
the nearest post town, and the farmer, opening the letter, showed
that Lucy had said she had requested the bearer to drop it into
that office. Who that bearer was, none knew. Bitter was the
disappointment of Edward Houstoun. A beautiful vision had
crossed his path, had awakened his noblest impulses, kindled
his passionate devotion, and then vanished for ever. But she
had left ineradicable traces of her presence. His awakened
energies, his passionate longings, his altered life, all gave assurance
that she had been&mdash;that the bright ideal of womanly
beauty and tenderness, and gentleness and firmness, which lived
in his memory, was no dream of fancy. He anticipated little
pleasure now from the pursuits on which he had lately determined,
but his pride forbade him to relinquish them, and when
once they had been commenced, finding in mental occupation
his Lethe, he abandoned himself to them with all his accustomed
ardor.</p>

<p>Two years passed away with Edward Houstoun in the
most intense intellectual action, and in death-like torpor of the
affections. From the last his mother might have saved him,
had not her want of sympathy with his pursuits occasioned a
barrier of reserve and coolness to arise between them fatal to
her influence. During this time no token of Lucy's existence
had reached him: and it was with such a thrill as might have
welcomed a visitant from the dead, that, one morning as he
left his own house to proceed to the office in which he pursued<a class='page' name ='Page_211' id='Page_211' title='211'>&nbsp;</a>
his studies, he saw before him at some distance, yet without
any intervening object to interrupt his view of her, a form and
face resembling hers, though thinner and paler. The lady was
approaching him, with slow and languid steps; but as her
eyes were fixed upon the ground she did not perceive him, and
just as his throbbing heart exclaimed, "It is Lucy," and he
sprang forward to greet her, she entered a house and the door
closed on her. The inmates of that house were but slightly
known to him, as they had only lately moved into the street,
yet he hesitated not an instant in ringing the bell, and inquiring
of the servant who presented himself at the door, for Miss
Watson.</p>

<p>"Miss Watson, sir?" repeated the man, "there is no such
person living here."</p>

<p>"She may not live here, but I saw her enter your door, and
I wish to speak to her." At this moment Lucy crossed the
hall at its further end, and he sprang forward, exclaiming
"Lucy&mdash;Miss Watson&mdash;thank Heaven I see you once more!"</p>

<p>A slight scream from Lucy, and the tremor which shook
her frame, showed her recognition of him. She leaned for an
instant against the wall, too faint for speech or action, while he
clasped her hand in his; but a voice broke in upon his raptures
and her agitation&mdash;a sharp, angry voice, coming from a
lady who, leaning over the balustrade of the stairs, had seen
and heard all that was passing below.</p>

<p>"Lucy&mdash;Lucy&mdash;come up here&mdash;I am waiting for you&mdash;this
is certainly very extraordinary conduct&mdash;very extraordinary
indeed."</p>

<p>"You shall not go," said Edward Houstoun, while the red
blood flushed to his brow at the thought that his Lucy could
be thus ordered. Lucy's face glowed too, and there was a
proud flush from her eye, yet she resisted his efforts to detain
her, and when he placed himself before her to prevent her<a class='page' name ='Page_212' id='Page_212' title='212'>&nbsp;</a>
leaving him, she opened a door near her, and though he
followed her quickly through it, he was just in time to see her
rushing up a private staircase. He would not leave the house
without an interview, and going into one of the parlors, he
rang the bell, and requested to see Mrs. Blakely, the lady of
the house. She came, looking very haughty and very angry.
He apologized for his intrusion, but expressed a wish to see a
young lady, Miss Watson, who was, he perceived, under her
care. With a yet haughtier air, Mrs. Blakely replied, "I am
not acquainted with any young <i>lady</i> of the name of Watson.
Lucy Watson, the girl whom you met in the hall just now&mdash;is
my seamstress. If you wish to see her, I will send her down
to you, though I do not generally allow my servants to receive
their visitors here."</p>

<p>"I shall be happy to see her wherever you please," was Edward
Houstoun's very truthful reply.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blakely left him, and he stationed himself at the door
to watch for Lucy. Minutes, which seemed to him hours,
passed, and she came not. At length, as he was about to ring
again, steps were heard approaching; he turned quickly, but
it was not Lucy. The girl who entered handed him a sealed
note. He tore it open and read&mdash;"I dare not see you. When
you receive this I shall have left the house, and, as no one
knows whither I have gone, questions would be useless."</p>

<p>In an instant he was in the street, looking with eager eyes
hither and thither for some trace of the lost one. He looked
in vain, yet he went towards his office with happier feelings
than he had long known. He knew now where Lucy was, and
a thousand expedients suggested themselves, by which he could
not fail to see her. If he could only converse with her for a
few minutes, he was assured he could prevail on her to leave
her present position, of which he could not for a moment bear
to think. His heart swelled, his brow flushed, whenever the<a class='page' name ='Page_213' id='Page_213' title='213'>&nbsp;</a>
remembrance of that position flashed upon his mind, yet he
never for an instant regarded it as changing his relations with
Lucy, or lessening his desire to call her his. He recollected
with pleasure two circumstances which had scarcely been remarked
at the moment of their occurrence. The man who
had opened the door to him, when he saw him spring forward
to meet Lucy, had exclaimed, "Oh! it was <i>Miss</i> Lucy you
meant, sir;" and the girl who had handed the note had said,
"<i>Miss</i> Lucy has gone out, sir." It was evident she was not
regarded by the servants as one of themselves&mdash;she had not
been degraded by association with menials. This was true.
Lucy had made such separation on her part an indispensable
necessity, and Mrs. Blakely had been too sensible of the value
of one possessing so much taste and skill in all feminine adornments,
to hesitate about complying with her demand. This lady
was one of the <i>nouveaux riches</i>, who occupied her life in
scheming to attain a position to which neither birth nor education
entitled her. The brightest dream connected with her
present abode had been that its proximity to Lady Houstoun's
residence might lead to an acquaintance with one of the
proudest of that charmed circle in which Mrs. Blakely longed
to tread. Hitherto this had proved a dream indeed, but Edward
Houstoun's incursion into her domain, and the developments
made by it, might, she thought, with a little address,
render it a reality. It was with this purpose that she sent a
note to Lady Houstoun, requesting an interview with her on a
subject deeply connected with the honor of her family and the
happiness of her son. Immediately on despatching this note,
the servants were ordered to uncover the furniture in the drawing-room,
while she herself hastened to assume her most becoming
morning dress. Her labors were fruitless. "Lady
Houstoun would be at home to Mrs. Blakely till noon," was the
scarcely courteous reply to her carefully worded note. It was<a class='page' name ='Page_214' id='Page_214' title='214'>&nbsp;</a>
an occasion on which she could not afford to support her pride,
and she availed herself of the permission to call.</p>

<p>The interview between Lady Houstoun and Mrs. Blakely
would have been an interesting study to the nice observer of character.
The efforts on the part of the one lady to be condescending,
and on that of the other to be dignified, were almost
equally successful. Mrs. Blakely had seldom felt her wealth of
so little consequence as in the presence of her commanding
yet simply attired hostess, and Lady Houstoun had never been
more disposed to assert the privileges of her rank, than when
she heard that her son had forgotten his own so far as to visit
on terms of equality&mdash;nay, if Mrs. Blakely were to be believed,
positively to address in the style of a lover&mdash;a seamstress&mdash;the
seamstress of Mrs. Blakely.</p>

<p>"This is very painful intelligence to me, Mrs. Blakely&mdash;of
course you must be aware that Mr. Houstoun could only have
contemplated a temporary acquaintance with this girl. I do
not fear that in his most reckless moment he could have
thought of such a <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>&mdash;but this young woman must
be saved&mdash;she was a <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of Sir Edward Houstoun, and for
his sake must not be allowed to come to harm&mdash;may I trouble
you to send her to me?"</p>

<p>The request was given very much in the style of a command.
Mrs. Blakely would not confess that she had great
doubts of her power to comply with it, but this would have
been sufficiently evident to any one who had marked the uncertain
air and softened tone with which Lady Houstoun's
wishes were made known to Lucy. Indignant as she was at
Mrs. Blakely's impertinent interference, Lucy scarcely regretted
Lady Houstoun's acquaintance with her son's feelings. We do
not know that far below all those acknowledged impulses leading
her to comply with the lady's request, there did not lie
some romantic hope that influences were astir through which</p>

<a class='page' name ='Page_215' id='Page_215' title='215'>&nbsp;</a><span class="i0">"Pride might be quell'd and love be free,"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table></div>

<p>but this she did not whisper even to her own heart.</p>

<p>"Better that the lady should know all&mdash;she will act both
wisely and tenderly&mdash;perhaps for her son's sake, she will aid
me to leave New-York." Such was the only language into
which she allowed even her thought silently to form itself.</p>

<p>Arranging her simple dress with as much care as though
she were about to meet her lover himself, Lucy set out for her
interview with Lady Houstoun. She had but a short distance
to traverse, but she lingered on her way, oppressed by a tremulous
anxiety. She was apprehensive of she knew not what
or wherefore&mdash;for again and again her heart acquitted her of
all blame. At length she is at the door&mdash;it opens, and, with
a courtesy which the servants of Mrs. Blakely never show to a
visitor who comes without carriage or attendants, she is ushered
into the presence of Lady Houstoun. The lady fixes her eyes
upon her as she enters, bows her head slightly in acknowledgment
of her courtesy, and says coldly, "You are the young
woman, I suppose, whom Mrs. Blakely was to send to me?"</p>

<p>Lucy paused for a moment, to still the throbbing of her
heart, before she attempted to reply. The thought flashed
through her mind, "I am a woman, and young, and therefore
she should pity me"&mdash;but she answered in a low, sweet, tremulous
tone, "I am the Lucy Watson, madam, to whom Sir
Edward Houstoun was so kind."</p>

<p>At that name a softer expression stole over the Lady
Houstoun's face, and she glanced quickly at a portrait hanging
over the ample fireplace, which represented a gentleman of
middle age, dressed in the uniform of a colonel of the American
army. As she turned her eyes again on Lucy, she saw
that hers were fastened on the same object.</p>

<p>"You have seen Sir Edward?" she said in gentle tones.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_216' id='Page_216' title='216'>&nbsp;</a>"Seen him, lady!&mdash;I loved him&mdash;oh how dearly!"</p>

<p>"Honored him would be a more appropriate expression."</p>

<p>"I loved him, lady&mdash;we are permitted to love our God,"
said Lucy, firmly.</p>

<p>Lady Houstoun's brow grew stern again.&mdash;"And from this
you argue, doubtless, that you have a right to love his son."</p>

<p>Lucy's pale face became crimson, and she bent her eyes to
the ground without speaking&mdash;the lady continued&mdash;"I scarcely
think that you could yourself have believed that Edward
Houstoun intended to dishonor his family by a legal connection
with you."</p>

<p>The crimson deepened on Lucy's face, but it was now the
flush of pride, and raising her head she met Lady Houstoun's
eyes fully as she replied&mdash;"I could not believe that he ever
designed to dishonor himself by ruining the orphan child of
him who died in his father's defence."</p>

<p>"And you have intended to avail yourself of his infatuation.
The menial of Mrs. Blakely would be a worthy daughter,
truly, of a house which has counted nobles among its members."</p>

<p>"If I have resisted Mr. Houstoun's wishes&mdash;separated myself
from him, and resigned all hope of even looking on his face
again, it has not been from the slightest reverence for the nobility
of his descent, but from self-respect, from a regard to the
nobleness of my own spirit. I had eaten of your bread, lady,
and I could not do that which might grieve you&mdash;yet the
bread which had cost me so much became bitter to me, and I
left the home you had provided to seek one by my own honest
exertions. I have earned my bread, but not as a menial&mdash;not
in the companionship of the vulgar&mdash;and this Mrs. Blakely
could have told you."</p>

<p>"If your determination were, as you say, to separate yourself
from Mr. Houstoun, it is unfortunate that you should have
taken up your residence so near us."</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_217' id='Page_217' title='217'>&nbsp;</a>"I knew not until this morning that I was near you."</p>

<p>"If you are sincere in what you say, you will have no objection
now to leave New-York."</p>

<p>"I have no objection to go to any place in which I can
support myself in peace."</p>

<p>"As to supporting yourself, that is of no consequence. I
will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Lady Houstoun, it is of the utmost consequence
to me. I cannot again live a dependent on your
bounty."</p>

<p>"What can you do? Has your education been such that
you can take the situation of governess?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Merton was a highly educated man, and Mrs. Merton
an accomplished woman&mdash;it was their pleasure to teach me,
and mine to learn from them."</p>

<p>"Accomplished! There stands a harp which has just been
tuned by a master for a little concert we are to have this
evening. Can you play on it?"</p>

<p>Lucy drew the instrument to her and played an overture
correctly, yet with less spirit than she would have done had
her fingers trembled less.</p>

<p>"Can you sing?"</p>

<p>Elevated above all apprehension by the indignant pride
which this cold and haughty questioning aroused, Lucy
changed the music of the overture for a touching air, and,
sang, with a rich, full voice, a single stanza of an Italian
song.</p>

<p>"Italian! Do you understand it?"</p>

<p>"I have read it with Mr. Merton."</p>

<p>"This is fortunate. I have been for weeks in search of a
governess for a friend residing in the country. I will order the
carriage and take you there instantly&mdash;or stay&mdash;return home
and put up your clothes. I will send a coach for you."</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_218' id='Page_218' title='218'>&nbsp;</a>Again Lucy had vanished from Edward Houstoun's world,
nor could his most munificent bribes, nor most active cross-examination
win any other information from Mrs. Blakely's
household, than that "Miss Lucy went away in a carriage"&mdash;a
carriage whose description presented a <i>fac simile</i> to every
hackney-coach. Spite of all her precautions, he suspected his
mother; to his consciousness of her want of sympathy with
his pursuits, was therefore added a deep sense of injury, and
his heart grew sterner, his manner colder and more reserved
than ever. Two years more were passed in his studies, and a
third in the long delays, the fruitless efforts which mark the
entrance on any career of profitable exertion. During all this
time, Lady Houstoun was studious to bring around him the
loveliest daughters of affluence and rank. Graceful forms
flitted through her halls, and the music of sweet voices and
the gay laughter of innocent and happy hearts were heard
within her rooms, but by all their attractions Edward Houstoun
was unmoved. Courteous and bland to all, he never
lingered by the side of one&mdash;no quick flush, no flashing beam
told that even for a passing moment his heart was again awake.
Could it be that from all this array of loveliness he was
guarded by the memory of her who had stamped the impress
of herself on his whole altered being? If the gratification of
the man's sterner ambition could have atoned for the disappointment
of the youth's dream of love, the shadow of that
memory would have passed from his life. Step by step he had
risen in the opinions of men, and at length one of the most
profound lawyers of the day sought his association with himself
in a case of the most intense interest, involving the honor
of a lovely and much-wronged woman. His reputation out of
the halls of justice had already become such that many thronged
the court to hear him. Gallant gentlemen and fair ladies
looked down on him from the galleries&mdash;but far apart from<a class='page' name ='Page_219' id='Page_219' title='219'>&nbsp;</a>
these, in a distant corner, sat one whose tall form was enveloped
in a cloak, and whose face was closely veiled. Beneath
that cloak throbbed a mother's heart, and through that veil a
mother's eyes sought the face she loved best on earth. He
knew not she was there, for she rarely now asked a question
respecting his engagements, or expressed any interest in his
movements, yet how her ears drank in the music of his voice,
and her eyes flashed back the proud light that shone in his!
As she listened to his delineation of woman's claims to the
sympathy and the defence of every generous heart, as she
heard his biting sarcasm on the cowardly nature that, having
wronged, would now crush into deeper ruin his fair client, as
she saw kindling eyes fixed upon him, and caught, when he
paused for a moment exhausted by the rush of indignant feeling,
the low murmur of admiring crowds, how she longed to
cry aloud, "My son&mdash;my son!" He speaks again. Higher
and higher rises his lofty strain, bearing along with it the passions
of the multitude. He ceases&mdash;and, as though touched
by an electric shock, hundreds spring at once to their feet.
The emphatic "Silence!" of the venerable judge hushes the
shout upon their lips, but the mother has seen that movement,
and, bursting into tears of proud triumphant joy, she finds her
way below, and is in the street before the verdict which his
eloquence had won was pronounced.</p>

<p>Edward Houstoun had fitted up a room in his mother's
house as a study, and over his accustomed seat hung his father's
portrait. To that room he went on his return from the scene
we have described. Beneath the portrait stood one who seldom
entered there. She turned at the opening of the door&mdash;the
lip, usually so firmly compressed, was quivering with emotion,
and those stern eyes were full of tears. She advanced to
him, drew near, and resting her head upon his shoulder whispered,
"I, too, am a woman needing tenderness&mdash;shut not<a class='page' name ='Page_220' id='Page_220' title='220'>&nbsp;</a>
your heart against me, my son, for without you I am alone in
the world."</p>

<p>The proud spirit had bent, the sealed fountain was opened,
and as he clasped his arms around her, the tears of mother
and son mingled; but amidst the joy of this reunion Edward
Houstoun felt more deeply than he had done for long months
the desolation that had fallen on his life. His heart had been
silent&mdash;it now spoke again, and sad were its tones.</p>

<p>It is summer. The courts are closed, and all who can are
escaping from the city's heat to the cool, refreshing shades of
the country. Woe to those who remain! The pestilence has
stretched her wings over them. The shadow and the silence
of death has fallen on their deserted streets. The yellow-fever
is in New-York&mdash;introduced, it is said, by ships from the West
Indies. Before it appeared Edward Houstoun was far away.
He was travelling to recruit his exhausted powers&mdash;to Niagara,
perhaps into Canada, and in the then slow progress of news
he was little likely to be recalled by any intelligence from the
city. His mother was one of the first who had sickened. And
where were now the fair forms that had encircled her in health&mdash;where
the servants who had administered with obsequious
attention to her lightest wish? All had fled, for no gratified
vanity&mdash;no low cupidity can give courage for attendance on the
bed of one in whose breath death is supposed to lurk. The
devotedness of love, the self-sacrifice of Christian Charity, are
the only impulses for such a deed. Yet over the sufferer is
bending one whose form in its perfect development has richly
fulfilled its early promise, and whose face is more beautiful in
the gentle strength and thoughtfulness of womanhood than it
had been in all its early brightness. In her peaceful home,
where the reverent love of her young pupils and the confidence
of their parents had made her happy, Lucy had heard from
one of Lady Houstoun's terrified domestics of the condition in<a class='page' name ='Page_221' id='Page_221' title='221'>&nbsp;</a>
which she had been left, and few hours sufficed to bring her to
her side. Days and nights of the most assiduous watchfulness,
cheered by no companionship, followed, and then the physician,
as he stood beside his patient and marked her regular
breathing, her placid sleep, and the moisture on her brow, whispered,
"You have saved her."</p>

<p>We will not linger to describe the emotion with which
Lady Houstoun, awakening from this long and tranquil slumber,
exhausted, but no longer delirious, first recognised her
nurse. At first, no doubt, painful recollections were aroused,
but with the feebleness of childhood had returned much of its
gentleness and susceptibility, and Lucy was at once so tender
and so cheerful, that very soon her ministerings were received
with unalloyed pleasure.</p>

<p>Sickness is a heavenly teacher to those who will open their
hearts to her. Lady Houstoun arose to a new life. She had
stood so near to death that she seemed to have looked upon
earth in the light of eternity. In that light, rank and title, with
all their lofty associations and splendid accompaniments, faded
away, while true nobleness, the nobleness which dwells in the
Christian precept "Love your enemies&mdash;do good to those that
despitefully use you," stood out in all its beauty and excellence.</p>

<p>As soon as Lady Houstoun could be removed with safety,
she went, by the advice of her physician, to her country-seat.
Lucy would now have returned to her pupils&mdash;she feared every
day lest Edward Houstoun should appear, and a new contest
be necessary with his feelings and her own&mdash;but Lady Houstoun
still pleaded her imperfectly restored health as reason for another
week's delay, and Lucy could not resist her pleadings.</p>

<p>It was afternoon, and Lucy sat in the library, which was
in the rear of the house, far removed from its public entrance.
Spenser's Faery Queen was in her hand, but she had turned
from its witching pages to gaze upon the title-page, on which<a class='page' name ='Page_222' id='Page_222' title='222'>&nbsp;</a>
was written, in Edward Houstoun's hand, "June 24th, 18&mdash;."
It was the day, as Lucy well remembered, on which he had
first revealed his love, and chosen his career in life. She was
aroused from her reverie by Lady Houstoun's entrance. As she
held the door open, the bright sunlight from an opposite window
threw a shadow on the floor which made Lucy's heart
throb painfully. She looked eagerly forward&mdash;a manly form
entered and stood before her. She could not turn from the
pleading eyes which were fixed with such intense earnestness
on hers. With a bewildered half-conscious air she rose from
her chair. He came near her and extended his arms. One
glance at the smiling Lady Houstoun showed Lucy that her
interdict was removed, and the next instant she lay in speechless
joy once more upon her lover's bosom.</p>

<p>We were within three days of the New Year. Mr. Arlington,
who was quite learned on the subject, had been amusing us
with an account of its various modes of celebration in various
countries. He was perfectly brilliant in a description of New-York
as seen under the sun of a clear, frosty New-Year's morning,
with snow enough to make the sleighing good. The gay, fantastic
sleighs, dashing hither and thither, and their exhilarated
occupants bowing now on this side and now on that, to acquaintances
rushing by almost too rapidly to be distinguished,
while the silvery bells ring out their merry peals on the still
air. Then the festive array which greets the caller at every
house within which he enters. Beauty adorned with smiles
and dress, gayly decorated tables, brightly burning fires, and
every thing seeming to speak the welcome not of mere form,
but of hearty hospitality. There is one aspect in which he
presents this day to us, that is peculiarly pleasing. He says,
that many a slight estrangement, springing from some one of
those "trifles" which "make the sum of human life," has been
prevented, by the influence of this day, from becoming a life-long
enmity. Thus the New-Year's day becomes a Peace-maker,
and has on it the blessing of Heaven. Long live the
custom which has made it such!</p>

<p>"And how shall we celebrate our New-Year?" asked Col.
Donaldson.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_224' id='Page_224' title='224'>&nbsp;</a>"Let us introduce the New-York custom," suggested one.</p>

<p>"That would not do without some previous agreement with
your neighbors," replied Mr. Arlington, "as their ladies would
not probably be prepared for your visits, and while you were
making them, the ladies of your own family would be left to
entertain themselves as they could."</p>

<p>"That will never do," said Col. Donaldson; "better invite
all our neighbors to visit us on that day. Suppose we give
them a dinner?"</p>

<p>"Oh, papa!" cried Miss Donaldson in dismay. And "My
dear husband!" ejaculated the smiling Mrs. Donaldson, "where
would you find room to accommodate them all?"</p>

<p>"True&mdash;true&mdash;we could not dine them in the open air at
this season."</p>

<p>"But there would be no such objection to an evening
party," said one of the young Donaldsons. "We have fine
sleighing now, and the moon rises only a little after eight on
New-Year's evening; why not invite them for the evening."</p>

<p>"What, another such stiff affair as Annie insisted on entertaining
her friends the Misses Morrison with the last winter,
when I saw one of the poor girls actually clap her hands with
delight at the announcement of her carriage?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Leave it to me, and it shall not be a stiff affair
at all. We will appear in fancy dresses&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear Philip!" remonstrated Mrs. Donaldson.</p>

<p>"Oh! not you, my dear mother, nor my father, unless he
should like it&mdash;indeed, it shall be optional with all&mdash;but enough,
I am sure, will like to make it an entertaining variety."</p>

<p>"But where shall we get fancy dresses, distant as we are
from the city?" asked Annie.</p>

<p>"Leave yours to me, Annie, I have it ready for you," said
Philip Donaldson, with so significant an air, that I at once suspected
this suggestion to have been the result of the arrival on<a class='page' name ='Page_225' id='Page_225' title='225'>&nbsp;</a>
that very day of a box, addressed to him by a ship from Constantinople,
of which he had hitherto made a great mystery.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Philip; but you cannot, I suppose, supply all
the company, and I had rather not be the only one in fancy
costume, if you please."</p>

<p>"If mamma will surrender to me the key of that great
wardrobe, up stairs, which contains the brocade dresses, shoe-buckles,
knee-buckles, etc., of our great-grandfathers and grandmothers,
I will promise to supply dresses for our own party, at
least, with a little aid from the needles and scissors."</p>

<p>"I bar scissors," cried Col. Donaldson. "Those venerable
heir-looms&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shall not lose a shred, sir," said Philip; "the scissors
shall only be used to cut the threads, with which the ladies
take in a reef here and there, when it is necessary."</p>

<p>"But you have provided only for our party. Are our
guests not to be in costume?"</p>

<p>"That may be as they please. We will express the wish,
and if they have any ingenuity, they can have no difficulty in
getting up some of the staple characters of such a scene, flower-girls
and shepherdesses, sailors, sultans, and beggars."</p>

<p>The scheme seemed feasible enough, when thus presented,
and had sufficient novelty to please the young people. It was
accordingly adopted, and the evening was passed in writing invitations,
which were dispatched at an early hour the next
morning. The three succeeding days were days of pleasurable
excitement, in preparation for the f&ecirc;te. Needles and scissors
were both in active use, and the brocade dresses lost, I am
afraid, more than one shred in the process of adjusting them
to the figures for which they were now designed. Mrs. Dudley
and Mrs. Seagrove were thus arranged as rival beauties of the
court of Queen Anne. Philip Donaldson, with the aid of a
bag-wig, for which Mr. Arlington has written at his request to<a class='page' name ='Page_226' id='Page_226' title='226'>&nbsp;</a>
a friend, in what city I may not say, and with some of his
father's youthful finery, and the shoe and knee-buckles aforesaid,
will make an excellent beau for these belles. Col. Donaldson,
always ready for any harmless mirth, says they must accept
him in his father's continental uniform for another. Mr. Arlington
makes quite a mystery of his costume, but it is a mystery
already revealed, both to Col. Donaldson and Philip, as I
can plainly perceive by the significant glances they exchange
whenever an allusion is made to it. Robert Dudley is to be a
page, Charles Seagrove, a beautiful boy of six years old, an
Oberon, and our little Eva a Titania. Mrs. Donaldson and I
were permitted to appear in our usual dress, and Miss Donaldson
strenuously claimed the same privilege, but it was not allowed.
She resisted all entreaties, even from her favorite brother
Arthur; but when her father gravely regretted her inability
to sympathize with the enjoyments of others, she was overcome.
Having yielded, she yielded entirely, and was willing to wear
anything her sisters wished. As she is considered by them all,
even in her thirty-third year, as the beauty of the family, her
dress has been more carefully studied by them than any other.
Every book of costumes within their reach was searched for it
again and again, without success; one was rich, but unbecoming,
another pretty, but it did not suit her style, and a third all
they desired, but unattainable at so short a notice. As a last
resource, my engravings were resorted to, and there, to my own
surprise, they found what satisfied all their demands. One of
the historical prints showed the dress worn in her bridal days
by Hotspur's Kate. Miss Donaldson accepted it thankfully, as
being less <i>bizarre</i> than any yet proposed to her, requiring nothing
more than a full skirt of white satin, a jacket not very
unlike the modern Polka, and a bridal veil. One condition she
insisted on, however, namely, that Arthur should be her Hotspur.
To this he consented without difficulty, not without an<a class='page' name ='Page_227' id='Page_227' title='227'>&nbsp;</a>
eye, I suspect, to the appearance of his tall, erect, graceful
form and bearing in such a dress as Hotspur's.</p>

<p>The last evening of the Old Year had arrived, our preparations
were completed, and our little party were experiencing
something of that <i>ennui</i> which results from having nothing to
do, when, in putting away the materials lately in use, Annie
took up my engraving of Hotspur and Kate. Handing it to
me, she said. "I know these engravings are precious, Aunt
Nancy, though what can be the association with this one, I am,
I acknowledge, at a loss to conceive."</p>

<p>"And yet it is a very simple one. I treasure it in memory
of my friend Harry Percy and his bride."</p>

<p>"What! Hotspur?" questioned Annie with dilating eyes.</p>

<p>"Not quite, though he was a lineal descendant of the old
Percys, and hot enough on occasion, too."</p>

<p>"You mean Colonel Percy of the British army, who married
Miss Sinclair, of Havre de Grace, during our last war with
England, or immediately after it, I never quite understood
which. There seemed some mystery about the marriage, and I
did not like to inquire too closely, but I dare say now, Aunt
Nancy, you can tell us all about it."</p>

<p>"I believe I can. See Annie, if among these packages you
can find one labelled 'The Test of Love.'"</p>

<p>"What! another story of a proud beauty winning her
glove and losing her lover?" asked Mr. Arlington.</p>

<p>"No; my test, or rather my hero's test, was somewhat different,"
I replied, as I received the package from Annie, and
read,</p>


<h3><a name="THE_TEST_OF_LOVE" id="THE_TEST_OF_LOVE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE TEST OF LOVE:</a></h3>

<h4>A STORY OF THE LAST WAR.</h4>

<p>When Mr. Sinclair, the rector of St John's, in Havre de Grace
took possession of his pretty parsonage, and persuaded the<a class='page' name ='Page_228' id='Page_228' title='228'>&nbsp;</a>
fair and gentle Lucy Hillman to preside over his unpretending
<i>m&eacute;nage</i>, and to share the comforts that lay within the compass
of his stipend of one thousand dollars per annum, he felt that
his largest earthly desires were fulfilled. A daughter was given
to him, and with a grateful heart he exclaimed&mdash;"Surely Thou
hast made my cup to overflow."</p>

<p>But he too was a man "born to trouble." He too must
be initiated into those "sacred mysteries of sorrow," through
which the High-priest of his profession had passed. In the
succeeding ten years, three other children opened their soft,
loving eyes in his home, made its air musical with their glad
voices and ringing laughter, and just as he had learned to listen
for the pattering of their dimpled foot, and his heart had
throbbed joyously to their call, they were borne from his arms
to the grave, and the echoes which they had awakened in his
soul were hushed for ever. Still his Lucy and their first-born
were spared, and as he drew them closer to his heart he could
"lift his trusting eyes" to Him from whom his faith taught
him no real evil could come to the loving spirit. The shadow
of earth had fallen on his heart, but the light of heaven still
beamed brightly there. Years passed with Mr. Sinclair in that
deep quiet of the soul which is "the sober certainty of waking
bliss." His labors were labors of love, and he was welcomed
to repose by all those charms which woman's taste and woman's
tenderness can bring clustering around the home of him to
whom her heart is devoted. But a darker trial than any he
had yet known awaited him.</p>

<p>War is in our borders, and that quiet town in which Mr.
Sinclair's life has passed is destined to feel its heaviest curse.
Its streets are filled with soldiery. The dark canopy of smoke
from which now and then a lurid flame shoots upward, shows
that their work is destruction, and that they will do it well.
Terrified women flit hither and thither, mingling their shrieks<a class='page' name ='Page_229' id='Page_229' title='229'>&nbsp;</a>
in a wild and fiend-like concert with the crack of musketry,
the falling of houses, and the loud huzzas and fierce outcries of
excited men. At a distance from that quarter in which the
strife commenced, stands a simple village church, within whose
shadow many of those who had worshipped in its walls during
the last half century, have lain down to rest from the toils of
life. No proud mausoleum shuts the sunshine from those lowly
graves. Drooping elms and willows bend over them, and
the whispering of their long pendent branches, as the summer
breeze sweeps them hither and thither, is the only sound that
breaks the stillness of that hallowed air. Near the church, on
the opposite side from this home of the dead, lies a garden,
whose roses and honey-suckles perfume the air, while its bowers
of lilac and laburnum, of myrtle and jessamine, almost
shut from the view the pretty cottage to which it belongs. All
around, all within that cottage, is silent. Have its inmates
fled?</p>

<p>The neighboring houses have been long deserted, and those
who left them would gladly have persuaded their pastor to accompany
them; but when they called to urge his doing so, he
could only point to the bed on which, already bereft of sense,
and evidently fast passing from life, lay one "all lovely to the
last." Mrs. Sinclair's health, delicate for years, had rapidly
failed in the last few months, till her anxious husband and child,
aware that a moment's acceleration of the pulse, a moment's
quickening of the breath from whatever cause, might snatch
her from their arms, learned to modulate every tone, to guard
every look and movement in her presence. But they could
not shut from her ears the boom of the cannon which heralded
the approach of the foe&mdash;they could not hush the startling
cries with which others met the announcement of their
arrival, and the first evidences of that savage fury which
desolated their homes, and left a dark stain on the escutcheon<a class='page' name ='Page_230' id='Page_230' title='230'>&nbsp;</a>
of Britain. Mrs. Sinclair uttered no cry when her terrors were
thus excited, she even strove to smile upon her loved ones, to
raise their drooping hearts; and in this, woman's holiest task,
the springs of her life gave way&mdash;not with a sudden snap, but
slowly, gently&mdash;so that for hours her husband and daughter
stood watching the shadow of death steal over her, hoping yet
to catch one glance of love, one whispered farewell ere she
should pass for ever from them.</p>

<p>"Fear not, my child," said Mr. Sinclair, when their sad
vigils were first interrupted by those who urged their flight&mdash;"they
are enemies, it is true, but they are Englishmen, a peaceful
clergyman, a defenceless woman, are safe in their hands&mdash;they
will not harm us."</p>

<p>"I have no fear, no thought of them, father!" said Mary
Sinclair, as she turned weeping to the only object of fear, or
hope, or thought, at that moment.</p>

<p>But soon others of Mr. Sinclair's parishioners came to warn
him that his confidence had been misplaced, that no character,
no age, no sex, had proved a protection from the ruthless fury
of their assailants. He would now have persuaded his daughter
to accompany her friends to a place of safety, and when
persuasions proved vain he would have commanded her, but,
lifting her calm eyes to his, she said, "Father have you not
taught me that, in all God's universe, the only safe place for us
is that to which our duty calls us&mdash;and is not my duty here?"</p>

<p>A colder heart would have argued with her, and might,
perhaps, have proved to her that her duty was not there&mdash;that
her father could watch the dying, and that it was her duty
to preserve herself for him; but Mr. Sinclair folded her in his
arms while his lips moved for an instant in earnest prayer, and
then, turning to his waiting friends, he said, "Go, go, my
friends&mdash;I thank you&mdash;but God has called us to this, and he will
care for us."</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_231' id='Page_231' title='231'>&nbsp;</a>When the work of desolation had been completed in the
quarter first attacked, parties of soldiers straggled off from the
main body in search of further prey. Fearful was it to
meet these men&mdash;their faces blackened with smoke, their hands
stained with blood, fierce frowns upon their brows, and curses
on their lips. The parsonage presented little attraction in its
external aspect to men whose object was plunder, and they
turned first to larger and more showy buildings. These were
soon rifled; the noise of their ribald songs, their blasphemous
oaths and drunken revelry penetrating often the chamber of
death, yet scarcely awakening an emotion in the presence of
the great Destroyer. At length the little gate is flung rudely
open, and unsteady but heavy steps ascend from the court-yard
to the house. They cross the piazza, they enter the parlor
where life's gentlest courtesies and holiest affections have hitherto
dwelt, the door of the room beyond is thrown open, and
two men stand upon its threshold, sobered for an instant by the
scene before them. There, pale, emaciated, the dim eyes closed,
and the face wearing that unearthly beauty which seems the
token of an adieu too fond, too tender, too sacred for human
language, from the parting spirit to its loved ones, the wife and
mother, speechless, senseless, yet not quite lifeless, lay propped
by pillows. At her side knelt Mr. Sinclair; the pallor of deep,
overpowering emotion was on his cheek, yet in his lifted eyes
there was an expression of holy faith, and you might almost
have fancied that a smile lay upon the lips which were breathing
forth the hallowed strains of prayer&mdash;"Save and deliver us, we
humbly beseech Thee, from the hands of our enemies, that we,
being armed with thy defence, may be preserved evermore
from all perils, to glorify Thee, who art the only giver of all
victory, through the merits of thy Son, Jesus Christ our Lord&mdash;Amen."</p>

<p>Dark, sinful men as they were, fresh from brutal crime,<a class='page' name ='Page_232' id='Page_232' title='232'>&nbsp;</a>
those strains touched a long silent chord in their hearts&mdash;a
chord linked with the memory of a smiling village in their own
distant land&mdash;with a mother's love and the innocence of childhood.
Faint&mdash;faint, alas! were those memories, and Mr. Sinclair's
"amen" had scarcely issued from his lips, when the eyes
of the leader rested on the beautiful face of Mary Sinclair, as,
pressed to the side of her father, she stretched her arms out
over her dying mother, and turned her eyes imploringly on
their dreaded visitors. The ruffians sprang forward with words
whose meaning was happily lost to the failing sense of the
terror-stricken girl. Mr. Sinclair started to his feet, and with
one arm still clasped around his daughter, stood between her
and the worse than murderers before him, prepared to defend
her with his life. For the first time he thirsted for blood, and
looked around for some weapon of destruction&mdash;but his was the
abode of peace&mdash;no weapon was there. Unarmed, with that
loved burden&mdash;loved at this moment even to agony, resting
upon him&mdash;he stood opposed to two fierce men armed to the
teeth. A father's strength in such a cause, who shall estimate?&mdash;yet,
alas! his adversaries were demons, relentless in purpose,
and possessed of that superhuman force which passion gives.
Weary of killing, or influenced by that superstition which
sometimes rules the soul from which religion is wholly banished,
they did not avail themselves of their swords. With
fierce threats they unclasped his arm from that senseless form,
which sank instantly to the floor at his feet, and drew him
across the room. They would have forced him into the parlor,
but his resistance was desperate, and ere they could accomplish
this, the sound of a drum beating the recall was borne faintly
to their ears. Leaving his comrade to hold the wildly struggling
father, the bolder ruffian turned back toward the still
prostrate Mary. At that moment, before she had been polluted
by a touch, the door was thrown violently back, and a tall,<a class='page' name ='Page_233' id='Page_233' title='233'>&nbsp;</a>
manly form strode through it. The gilded epaulettes and
drooping feather told his rank, before the step of pride and
countenance of stern command had conveyed to the mind the
conviction that you stood in the presence of one accustomed to
be obeyed. The man who grasped Mr. Sinclair loosened his
hold and shrank cowering away. He went unnoticed, for the
eye of the officer had fallen upon him who was in the act of
stooping to lift Mary Sinclair from the floor. With a single
spring he was at his side, and catching him by the collar of
his coat, he hurled him from him with such force that he fell
stunned against the farther wall. Mr. Sinclair was already
bending over his daughter. As he raised her on his arm her
head fell back, exposing her face, around which her dark hair
swept in dense masses. Her features were of chiselled beauty,
and had they been indeed of marble they could not have been
more bloodless in their hue, while her jetty lashes lay as still
upon her cheek as though the hand of death had sealed her
eyes for ever. Mr. Sinclair had no such fear. He knew that she
had only fainted, and rejoiced that God in his mercy had
spared her the worst horrors of the scene; but as Captain
Percy's eyes rested on her, a deeper scowl settled on his brow,
and in a hoarse whisper he asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have they harmed her, sir?"</p>

<p>"Not by a touch, thank God! not by a touch!" exclaimed
the father, as he pressed her with passionate joy to his heart&mdash;ay,
joy, even in the presence of her so long the light of his
life now passing for ever from earth. For a few minutes the
dying had been forgotten, for what was death&mdash;a death of
peace&mdash;to the long misery into which man's base, brutal passion
would have converted the life of that pure and lovely girl?
Now, however, she was safe, and still supporting her on his
arm, Mr. Sinclair turned to his wife and tenderly moistened her
parched lips. What a mockery of all human cares seemed that<a class='page' name ='Page_234' id='Page_234' title='234'>&nbsp;</a>
pale, peaceful brow&mdash;peaceful, while he whose lightest sorrow
had thrown a shadow on her life was suffering anguish inexpressible,
and the child who had lain in her bosom, to the
lightest throb of whose heart her own had answered, lay senseless
from terror in his arms. It was a scene to touch the hardest
heart, and Captain Percy's heart was not hard. He looked
around for the men whom he had interrupted in their hellish
designs&mdash;they were not there.</p>

<p>"Is this their work?" he asked of Mr. Sinclair, pointing to
his scarcely breathing wife.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;this is the gentle hand of our Father," said Mr.
Sinclair, as he bent his head and touched with his lips the
sunken cheek dearer to him now than it had been in all its
girlish roundness. The blood had begun to cast a slight tinge
of red into the lips of Mary Sinclair before Captain Percy had
left the room in search of the men whom he was unwilling to
leave behind him, and when he returned, the tremor of her
form and the close clasp with which she clung to her father,
proved that her consciousness and her memory were awake.
His step had startled her, and as he entered he heard Mr.
Sinclair say, "Fear not, my daughter, that is the step of your
deliverer, and though he is an English soldier&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I pray you, sir, judge not Englishmen by ruffians like
these&mdash;a disgrace to the name of man. Believe me, every
country has within it wretches, who, at moments such as this,
when all social restraints are withdrawn, become demons. But
I must leave you, in safety, I trust, as I have sent to the ships
all the soldiers whom I could discover in your neighborhood."</p>

<p>"Farewell, sir," said Mr. Sinclair, extending his hand&mdash;"God
reward you for the timely aid you have this day brought
to the defenceless. Look up, my child, and join your thanks
with mine."</p>

<p>Mary Sinclair raised her head from her father's bosom, and<a class='page' name ='Page_235' id='Page_235' title='235'>&nbsp;</a>
lifting her eyes for an instant to the face of Captain Percy, unclosed
her lips to speak, but voice and words were denied her.</p>

<p>"God bless you, lady!" he exclaimed, as taking her hand
he raised it to his lips, and relinquishing it with one glance of
sympathy at the dying, turned away and passed from the room.
He returned once more, but it was only to leave his pistols with
Mr. Sinclair.</p>

<p>"They are loaded, sir, and in such a cause as you needed
them just now, even a Christian minister may use them."</p>

<p>Captain Percy spoke rapidly, only glancing at Mary, who
was already bending with self-forgetful devotion above her mother's
pillow, and before Mr. Sinclair could answer he was
gone.</p>

<p>All was again silent in that deserted suburb, and for long
hours nothing disturbed the solemn stillness of the chamber of
death, save the low sob or earnest prayer of parting love, though
sounds of tumult had not ceased wholly in the village. The
invaders had been interrupted in their work of destruction by
an alarm from some of their own party of an approaching foe.
They hurried to their ships with mad impetuosity, conscious that
their acts deserved only war to the knife, and that they were not
prepared to cope with any regular force. Only they, who, like
Captain Percy, had held themselves aloof from the brutal barbarities
which they had striven vainly to prevent, were now
composed enough to take any steps for the safety of others.
To collect those who had straggled off was the first business,
and while the recall was hastily beaten, Captain Percy, selecting
a small party of men on whom he could depend, went to patrol
the more distant quarters of the town. Having seen no trace
of an enemy on his way to the parsonage, he had somewhat
hastily concluded the alarm to be false, and therefore did not
hesitate, before returning with his pistols to Mr. Sinclair, to send
forward his men in charge of those whom he had found, promis<a class='page' name ='Page_236' id='Page_236' title='236'>&nbsp;</a>ing
to join them before they reached the point of embarcation.
Without a thought of danger he traversed the silent and deserted
streets on his return, and had arrived where a single turn
would bring him within view of the rallying point of his companions
in arms, when the sound that met his practised ears
told of something more than the hurrying tread and mingling
voices of soldiers rapidly embarking. Had his men been opposed?
If so, they should not be without a leader&mdash;and with
that thought he sprang forward. He was too late. Already
they had fought their way through the band of villagers, who,
maddened by the desolation of their homes, had gathered together
such weapons as they could, and led on by one gallant
and experienced soldier, whom their burning houses had lighted
to their aid, were seeking to cut off the retreat of some amongst
their invaders, and thus to revenge those whom they had been
unable to protect. Captain Percy's men had, as we have said,
fought their way through this band&mdash;not without loss. He
now stood alone&mdash;one against many&mdash;with only his good
sword to aid, for his pistols he had given to Mr. Sinclair. To
retreat unobserved was impossible, for his own cry of "Forward&mdash;forward,
my men!" uttered as he rushed to the scene of the
just decided contest, had betrayed him&mdash;to fight against such
odds with the faintest hope of success was equally impossible,
and to yield was an alternative which there seemed to be no
intention of offering him. In an instant twenty swords flashed
before his eyes&mdash;twenty muskets were pointed at his breast.
That instant had been his last had not Major Scott, the leader
of whom we have spoken, sprang forward and placed himself
before him. Himself a brave and generous soldier, he could
not tamely witness such butchery; and pale with the terror for
another which he had never felt for himself, he exclaimed,
"Yield yourself, sir, quickly&mdash;a moment's delay, and I cannot
protect you."</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_237' id='Page_237' title='237'>&nbsp;</a>Captain Percy's sword was in the hand of his noble foe,
who, linking his arm in his, turned to face his own band, shouting
as he did so, "Back&mdash;back on your lives&mdash;he is my prisoner,
and who touches him makes me his enemy."</p>

<p>The day had passed with all its exciting incidents. The
glow of sunset had faded into twilight's soberer hues, and these
had deepened into the darkness of night. With the darkness
silence had settled upon the streets of Havre de Grace. They
who had trodden, for hours, with burning hearts around the
sites of their desecrated homes, retired to the house of some
charitable and more fortunate neighbor, to seek such rest as
misery may hope. They went with sullen as well as sad brows,
and as they passed one house in the village they muttered
"curses not loud, but deep." This was the house in which Major
Scott had found a refuge for himself and the prisoner, whom
all his influence had scarcely been able to protect. To remove
him from Havre de Grace in the light of day, and under the
eyes of his infuriated enemies, was too hazardous a project to be
attempted; and by the advice of some who seemed disposed to
second his efforts for his safety, he had delayed his departure
till night should veil the obnoxious features of the British
officer.</p>

<p>At the parsonage, death had accomplished his work, and
the room in which we have already seen Mr. Sinclair, bears the
solemn impress of his presence. Beside the bed on which the
lifeless limbs have been composed with tender care, the pastor
kneels. His prayer is no longer, "Let this cup pass from me"&mdash;he
is struggling for power to say, "Father, not my will, but
Thine be done!" In an upper room lies Mary Sinclair. Tears
are falling fast as summer rain-drops from her closed eyes; but
she utters neither sob nor moan, and by the dim light of the
shaded lamp she seems to the two women, who, with well-meant
but officious kindness, have insisted on watching with<a class='page' name ='Page_238' id='Page_238' title='238'>&nbsp;</a>
her through the night, to sleep. A slight noise in the street
causes one of these women to start, and she whispers to the
other, "I am 'feard of every thing to-night&mdash;the least noise
puts me all of a trimble, for I'm thinking of my Jack. He's
gone to guard that British soger, and I shouldn't wonder if he
had a skrimmage about him before morning."</p>

<p>"And I must say, Miss Dunham, if he did, it would be
nothin' more than them deserves us would go for to guard them
cruel British."</p>

<p>"But they do say, Miss Caxton, that this Capin&mdash;for Jack
says he is a Capin&mdash;was better than the rest&mdash;that he took the
part of our people every where when he found there wasn't any
fair fight, and that he was drivin' his men to the ships when we
caught him."</p>

<p>"Them may believe that that will, but for my part I think
that it must be a poor, mean speritted American that will hold
guard over one of them British&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not so mean speritted as you think perhaps," said Jack's
mother with a flushed face.</p>

<p>"Well, I must say, Miss Dunham, I never thought Jack
would do such a thing&mdash;if I had&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Caxton stopped abruptly, but her companion would
hear the whole&mdash;"Well ma'am, if you had&mdash;what if you had?"</p>

<p>"Why, then, Miss Dunham, I shouldn't have been so well
pleased to see him keepin' company with my Sarah&mdash;but after
this, of course, that's at an end."</p>

<p>"May be, Miss Caxton, you may think to-morrow mornin'
that it would have been just as well to wait till the night was
gone before you said that&mdash;when you see the British Capin
hanging by the neck in his fine regimentals, and hear that his
guard were the men that did it&mdash;as I know they've sworn to
do&mdash;you may think after all they an't so mean speritted."</p>

<p>"Miss Dunham! if they'll do that, I'll unsay every word<a class='page' name ='Page_239' id='Page_239' title='239'>&nbsp;</a>
I've said, and proud enough I would be to call one of 'em my
son-in-law&mdash;but now do tell me all about it&mdash;she's asleep you
see," glancing at Mary Sinclair, "and there an't nobody to
hear."</p>

<p>"Why, there an't much to tell. You see the Major wouldn't
give way any how at all about this here man&mdash;so, as they
didn't want to fight <i>him</i>, they agreed that some of the real
true blues who an't afeard of nothin', should seem to help the
Major and persuade him to keep the man here till late in the
night, and that they would guard him&mdash;but they were to take
care to have the key of his room, and when the Major goes
there he'll find it empty, or at best only a bloody corpse there.
They'll hang him if they can get him out of the window without
too much noise, but if there's any danger of his waking the
Major with his screeching, they'll stop his voice quick enough."</p>

<p>Any further conversation between these discreet watchers
was prevented by a sudden movement on the part of Mary
Sinclair. Springing from her bed she was hastening to the
door when her steps were arrested.</p>

<p>"Dear me, Miss Mary! where are you going? Now do
lie down again, my dear young lady!&mdash;be patient&mdash;it's the
Lord's will, you know." Such were the remonstrances of her
officious attendants, while, one on either side, they strove to lead
her back again, but Mary persisted.</p>

<p>"I must go to my father, Mrs. Dunham, pray let me go,
Mrs. Caxton, I must speak to my father."</p>

<p>"Well, then, my good young lady, just put your wrapping
gown around you first, and put your feet in these slippers."</p>

<p>Mary complied silently, and then was suffered to proceed.
Rapidly she flew to her father's room&mdash;it was unoccupied, and
a glance at his bed showed her that it had not been disturbed.
Mary was at no loss to conjecture where she should find her
father&mdash;but as she approached <i>that</i> room her steps grew slower,<a class='page' name ='Page_240' id='Page_240' title='240'>&nbsp;</a>
lighter&mdash;she was treading on holy ground. With difficulty
she nerved herself to turn the latch of the door, and in an awed
whisper she entreated her father to come to her. Mr. Sinclair
rose from his knees, but he lingered a moment to cast one look
on that still lovely face, to press his lips to that cold brow, and
then, reverently veiling it, he approached his daughter.</p>

<p>"Come quickly, papa!&mdash;not a moment is to be lost if you
would save him from death, and such a death&mdash;oh, papa, papa!&mdash;it
may be even now too late."</p>

<p>Her tale was rapidly told, and before it was concluded Mr.
Sinclair was ready for action.</p>

<p>"But the house, Mary, what house is he in?"</p>

<p>This Mary could not tell, but rapidly ascending the stairs to
her room, Mr. Sinclair obtained from the two gossips the information
he sought. Startled as they were by his appearance,
they reverenced the rector too much to question his designs.
Leaving his daughter to forget even her own heavy sorrow in
the imminent danger of another&mdash;of one whom, without any
very satisfactory reason, she as well as Mr. Sinclair had at once
concluded to be her deliverer of the morning&mdash;let us follow his
steps.</p>

<p>The church clock tolled eleven as Mr. Sinclair passed, and
the sound made his fleet movements fleeter still. Street after
street was traversed without a voice or tread, save his own,
breaking the stillness of the night. At length he reached the
point of the day's devastations. Dismantled and roofless
houses, from which a dull glimmer showed that the fire was
not yet wholly extinguished, were seen rising here and there,
while in intervening spaces a charred and smouldering heap
alone gave evidence that man had had his dwelling there. A
rapid glance as he passed without a pause over this ground
told its desolation. But see&mdash;what object meets his eye, and
causes every nerve to thrill with apprehension!  From the<a class='page' name ='Page_241' id='Page_241' title='241'>&nbsp;</a>
midst of one of those blackened heaps a single post shoots up&mdash;wildly
Mr. Sinclair casts his eyes upward to its summit&mdash;gracious
heaven! is he too late? To that post, about twenty
feet from the ground, a cross-piece is attached, to which a rope
has been secured, and from that rope a dark object hangs
motionless. Sick with horror he stops&mdash;he gazes&mdash;no! it is no
illusion&mdash;dimly defined against the star-lit sky, his eye, dilated
by terror, traces the form of man, and fancy supplies the traits
of him who stood before him but a few hours since in all the
flush of manhood&mdash;every moment replete with energy, every
look full of proud resolve and generous feeling. With a
searching glance Mr. Sinclair looks around for the murderers&mdash;but
they are gone&mdash;again, his strangely fascinated eye turns
to that object of horror. Is it the agitation of a death struggle
which causes it now to swing to and fro in the dusky air?
The thought that life may not yet be extinct gives him new
strength&mdash;he runs&mdash;he flies to Major Scott's lodgings, for from
him alone is he secure of aid in his present purpose.</p>

<p>As Mr. Sinclair approached the house in which Major Scott
had found accommodations for himself and his prisoner, he
found himself no longer in darkness. More than one burning
torch threw a lurid light upon the scene, while the men who
held them, and perhaps as many as twenty more stood clustered
together, near the house, against which some of them
were engaged in elevating a ladder. In what service that
ladder might have been last used Mr. Sinclair shuddered to
think. Perfect stillness reigned in this party. Their few orders
were given in whispers.</p>

<p>Keeping cautiously in shadow, and moving with stealthy
steps, Mr. Sinclair passed them and reached the house. Even
when there, he had little hope of making Major Scott hear him
without alarming them, and he could not doubt that they
would do every thing in their power to frustrate his object.<a class='page' name ='Page_242' id='Page_242' title='242'>&nbsp;</a>
But Heaven favored his merciful design&mdash;he touched the door
and found it ajar. All was dark as midnight within it, and he
had scarcely taken a step when he stumbled against a man
whose voice sounded fiercely even in the low whisper in which
he ejaculated, "D&mdash;n you. Do you want to wake the Major?
Don't you see you're at his room door?"</p>

<p>"I see now, but it was so dark at first," whispered Mr.
Sinclair in reply&mdash;adding with that quickness of perception and
readiness of invention which danger supplies to some minds&mdash;"I
have come to watch him&mdash;you are wanted."</p>

<p>The man obeyed the intimation, and he had no sooner
turned away than Mr. Sinclair laid his hand upon the latch of
the door which had been indicated as Major Scott's. It yielded
to his touch, and with a quick but cautious movement he entered
the room, and closed the door behind him. Cautious as
he was, the soldier's light sleep was broken, and he exclaimed
hurriedly, "Who's there?"</p>

<p>Mr. Sinclair's communication was made in a hasty whisper,
and Major Scott only heard enough to know that his prisoner
was in danger. Of Mr. Sinclair's worst suspicions he did not
even dream when, starting to his feet, half dressed, as he had
thrown himself on the bed, he snatched his pistols from under
his pillow, and exclaiming to Mr. Sinclair, "Follow me, sir,"
hurried to the scene of action, the room of Captain Percy.
Mr. Sinclair followed with rapid steps.</p>

<p>In one respect the conspirators had been disappointed&mdash;they
had not obtained the key of Captain Percy's room, for
being now a prisoner on parole, he was subject to no confinement.
He had, however, locked the door of his room himself,
to guard against the incursion of curiosity rather than of hostility;
but the lock was none of the strongest&mdash;a single vigorous
application of Major Scott's foot to the door started the screws
which held it, and a second burst it off and threw the entrance<a class='page' name ='Page_243' id='Page_243' title='243'>&nbsp;</a>
open before him. As Mr. Sinclair glanced forward, "Thank
God!" burst from his lips, to the no small surprise of Major
Scott, who saw little cause for gratitude in finding the object
of his solicitude retreating, sword in hand, towards the door,
while several athletic men, their faces dark with hate, were
already pressing dangerously upon him, and others were crowding
in at the opened window. The impetuous rush of his
friends freed Captain Percy for a moment from his assailants,
but they returned fiercely to the charge, too furious now to
postpone their revenge even to their deference for Major Scott.
Vain were Mr. Sinclair's entreaties to be heard, till their advance
was stayed by the sight of Major Scott's firearms&mdash;weapons
with which they had not furnished themselves, considering
them useless in an enterprise to whose complete success silence
was essential. Then first they listened to him as he exclaimed,
"This man is innocent, and if you shed his blood it will call to
Heaven for vengeance. I saw him myself this day oppose himself
to two of his own countrymen to save a defenceless
woman from injury. That woman was my daughter&mdash;some of
you know her well&mdash;ah, Thompson! you may well hang your
head&mdash;would you slay the deliverer of her whose good nursing
saved the life of your motherless child?&mdash;Wilson, it was but last
week that she sat beside your dying mother, and soothed and
comforted her&mdash;but for this good and brave man she would
now have been with her in heaven."</p>

<p>It was only necessary to gain a hearing for such words to
produce an influence on the rash, but not cruel men whom Mr.
Sinclair addressed, and scarcely half an hour had passed since
their entrance into the room, when they offered their hands in
pledge of amity to him whose life they had come to seek. As
a proof of their sincerity, they advised Major Scott no longer
to delay his departure from the town, and some of them volunteered
to accompany him as a guard to his country-seat.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_244' id='Page_244' title='244'>&nbsp;</a>"You have saved my life," said Captain Percy, as he shook
hands with Mr. Sinclair at parting.</p>

<p>"And you have preserved for me all, except my duties, for
which I can now desire to live," answered Mr. Sinclair with
emotion: then turning to Major Scott, he added, "as soon as
you consider it safe, you will, I hope, bring Captain Percy to
visit us. In the mean time, Captain Percy, remember that the
stranger and the prisoner are a clergyman's especial care, and
suffer yourself to want nothing which I can do for you. By-the
by," and he took Major Scott aside and whispered him.</p>

<p>"Give yourself no concern about that, my dear sir," said
Major Scott in reply, "I will attend to it."</p>

<p>He did attend to it, and Captain Percy's drafts on his captor
were promptly met, till he was able to open a communication
with the British commander.</p>

<p>In as quiet a manner as possible Major Scott and Captain
Percy moved off from the hotel, and were met in the suburbs
by their volunteer guard, while another party of the men whom
he had thus saved from a great crime, attended Mr. Sinclair
to his home. As he entered the area of the smouldering ruins
his eye sought the object lately viewed with so much horror.
He had scarcely glanced at it, when one of his companions
stepped up and disengaged a dark cloak from the noose already
prepared for its expected victim&mdash;"I knew no one would
steal it from the gallows," said the man, as he threw it over
his shoulders. Mr. Sinclair smiled to think how easily imagination
had transformed that harmless object into the fair proportions
of a man.</p>

<p>Nothing more was heard of Captain Percy for weeks&mdash;dreary
weeks to many in Havre de Grace&mdash;melancholy weeks
to the inmates of the parsonage, who missed at every turn the
familiar step and voice which had been life's sweetest music to
their hearts. At length Mr. Sinclair received a note from Ma<a class='page' name ='Page_245' id='Page_245' title='245'>&nbsp;</a>jor
Scott, announcing his own approaching departure to the
army on our northern frontier, and requesting permission for
Captain Percy and himself to call on Mr. and Miss Sinclair.
Permission was given&mdash;the call was made, and they who had
met only in scenes of terror and dismay, amidst flushing looks
and fierce words, now greeted each other with gentlest courtesy
among sounds and sights of peace. The call was succeeded
by a visit of some days, and this by one of weeks, till at last
it seemed to be understood that the parsonage was to be the
home of Captain Percy while awaiting the exchange which
Major Scott had promised to do all in his power to expedite.
His society was at the present time peculiarly pleasing to Mr.
Sinclair, who was diverted from his own sad thoughts by the
varied intelligence of the soldier and traveller in many lands.
Mary Sinclair had been unable to meet her deliverer without
a thrill of emotion which communicated an air of timidity to
her manner, whose usual characteristic was modest self-possession.
Captain Percy, at thirty-five, had outlived the age of
sudden and violent passion, but he had not outlived that of
deep feeling. A soldier from boyhood, he had visited almost
every clime, and been familiar with the beauties of almost
every land, yet in this lovely and gentle girl, whom he had
guarded from ill, and whom he now saw in all the pure and
tender associations of her home, blessing and blessed, there
was something which touched his heart more deeply than he
liked to acknowledge even to himself. Again and again when
he saw the soft, varying color that arose to her cheek at his
sudden entrance, or heard the voice in which she was addressing
another, sink into a more subdued tone as she spoke to
him, did he take his hat and wander forth, that he might still
in solitude his bosom's triumphant throb, and reason with himself
on the folly of suffering his affections to be enthralled by
one from whom, ere another day passed, he might be separated<a class='page' name ='Page_246' id='Page_246' title='246'>&nbsp;</a>
by orders which would send him thousands of miles away, and
detain him, perhaps, for years.</p>

<p>"If I thought her feelings were really interested," he would
say to himself at other times&mdash;"but nonsense&mdash;how can I be
such a coxcomb&mdash;all she can feel for me is gratitude."</p>

<p>This last sentiment was echoed by Mary Sinclair, who,
when self-convicted of unusual emotion in Captain Percy's presence,
ever repeated, "It is only gratitude."</p>

<p>One evening Mr. Sinclair retired after tea to his study, leaving
his daughter and his guest together. He had not been
gone long when a servant entered with the letters and papers just
brought by the semi-weekly mail, which conveyed to the inhabitants
of Havre de Grace news of the important events
then daily transpiring in distant parts of the country. The
only letter was a somewhat bulky one for Captain Percy.
Mary received the papers and commenced reading them, that
she might leave her companion at liberty. Had she been
looking at him she would have seen some surprise, and even a
little annoyance in his countenance as his eyes rested on the
seals of his dispatch. He opened it, and the annoyance deepened.
He read it more than once. Minutes passed in perfect
silence, and Mary began to wonder what correspondent could
so deeply interest him. A heavy sigh made her look up. His
letter lay open on the table before him, but he had evidently
long ceased to read, for his arm rested upon it, while his eyes
were fixed with an expression at once intent and mournful on
her. Mary thought only of him as she said, "I hope you have
no painful intelligence there, Captain Percy."</p>

<p>"I suppose I ought to consider it very joyful intelligence&mdash;I
am no longer a prisoner&mdash;I have been exchanged, and"&mdash;he
hesitated, looked away, then added rapidly&mdash;"I am ordered
immediately to join my regiment in Canada."</p>

<p>A quick drawing of the breath, as though from sudden<a class='page' name ='Page_247' id='Page_247' title='247'>&nbsp;</a>
pain, met his ear&mdash;his heart beat quickly, but he would not
embarrass her by a glance. There was a slight rustling of her
dress, and turning he saw that she had risen, and with one
hand pressed upon the table for support, was advancing to the
door. Falteringly, one&mdash;two&mdash;three steps were taken, and
completely overcome, pale and ready to faint, she sank upon a
sofa near her. He sprang forward, but she motioned him away,
and covering her face with her hands, burst into tears&mdash;tears
of shame as well as of sorrow. For an instant he stood irresolute&mdash;but
only for an instant, when bending over her, he
whispered, "Dare I hope that you sympathize with me, Mary&mdash;that
the feeling which made even liberty painful to me
since it separates me from you, is not confined to my own
bosom?"</p>

<p>Mary's sobs ceased&mdash;but she spoke not&mdash;moved not.</p>

<p>"Answer me, dear Mary&mdash;remember I have little time to
woo, for my orders admit of no delay in their execution&mdash;I
must leave you to-morrow. Rise then above the petty formalities
of your sex, and if I may indeed hope ever to call you
mine, let me do so this night&mdash;this hour&mdash;your father will not,
I think, fear to commit you to my tenderness."</p>

<p>Mary uncovered her face, and raised her eyes for an instant
to his, with an expression so confiding that he thought his
suit was won, and pressing her hand to his lips, he said,
"That glance tells me that you are my own, Mary. My life
shall prove my gratitude&mdash;but now I must seek your father&mdash;<i>our</i>
father&mdash;will you await us here?"</p>

<p>"I have something to say to you&mdash;sit down and hear me,"
said Mary, in a voice which she strove in vain to raise above a
whisper.</p>

<p>He placed himself beside her on the sofa, still clasping the
hand he had taken, and with a voice faltering and low at first,
but gathering strength as she proceeded, Mary resumed:&mdash;"I<a class='page' name ='Page_248' id='Page_248' title='248'>&nbsp;</a>
will not attempt&mdash;I do not wish to deny that you have read
my heart aright&mdash;that&mdash;that you who saved me are&mdash;are&mdash;"
a lover's ear alone could detect the next words&mdash;"very dear to
me&mdash;but I cannot&mdash;I think I ought not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused, and Captain Percy said, "You are not willing
to intrust your happiness to one so lately known."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! you mistake my meaning&mdash;I can have no doubt
of you&mdash;no fear for my own happiness&mdash;but my father&mdash;who
will care for him if I, his daughter, his only child, thus give
myself to another at the very time that he needs me most?"</p>

<p>"I will not take you from him&mdash;at least not now, Mary&mdash;give
me but the right to call you mine, and I will leave you
here in your own sweet home&mdash;not again, I trust, to be visited
by war&mdash;till peace shall leave me at liberty to return to England
with my bride&mdash;my wife."</p>

<p>He would have clasped her to him as he named her thus,
but Mary struggled almost wildly to free herself, exclaiming,
"Oh! plead not thus lest I forget my father in myself&mdash;my
duty in love&mdash;the forgetfulness would be but short&mdash;I should
be unhappy even at your side, when I thought of the loneliness
of heart and life to which I had condemned him."</p>

<p>"But he should go with us&mdash;he should have our home.
It will be a simple home, Mary&mdash;for though I come of a lordly
race, I inherit not their wealth&mdash;but it will be large enough
for our father."</p>

<p>"Kind and generous!" exclaimed Mary, as she suffered
her fingers to clasp the hand in which they had hitherto only
rested, "would that it might be so&mdash;but that were to ask of
my father a sacrifice greater even than the surrender of his
daughter&mdash;the sacrifice of his sense of duty to the people who
have chosen him as their spiritual father&mdash;and to whom he
considers himself bound for life."</p>

<p>Captain Percy remained silent long after she had ceased to<a class='page' name ='Page_249' id='Page_249' title='249'>&nbsp;</a>
speak, with his eyes resting on her downcast face. At length
in low, sad tones, he questioned, "And must we part thus?"</p>

<p>Mary's lips moved, but she could not speak.</p>

<p>"I will not ask you to remember me, Mary," he resumed,
"for if forgetfulness be possible to you, it will perhaps be for
your happiness to forget&mdash;yet&mdash;pardon me if I am selfish&mdash;I
would have some little light amidst the darkness gathering
around my heart&mdash;may I hope that had no duty forbidden
you would have been mine?"</p>

<p>She yielded to his clasping arm, and sinking on his bosom,
murmured there, "Yours&mdash;yours ever and only&mdash;yours wholly
if I could be yours holily."</p>

<p>From this interview Mary retired to her chamber, and
Captain Percy sought his host in his study. After communicating
to Mr. Sinclair the contents of the dispatch he had just
received, he continued, "I must in consequence of these orders
leave you immediately&mdash;but before I go I have a confession to
make to you. You will not wonder that your lovely daughter
should have won my heart; but one hour since, I could
have said that I had never yielded for an instant to that heart's
suggestions&mdash;had never consciously revealed my love, or endeavored
to excite in her feelings which, in my position and
the present relations of our respective countries, could scarcely
fail to be productive of pain. I can say so no longer. The
moment of parting has torn the veil from the hearts of both&mdash;she
loves me,"&mdash;there was a joyous intonation in Captain
Percy's voice as he pronounced these last words. He was
silent a moment while Mr. Sinclair continued to look gravely
down&mdash;then suddenly he resumed&mdash;"Pardon my selfishness&mdash;I
forget all else in the sweet thought that I am loved by
one so pure, so gentle, so lovely. But though I have dared
without your permission to acknowledge my own tenderness,
and to draw from her the dear confession of her regard, there<a class='page' name ='Page_250' id='Page_250' title='250'>&nbsp;</a>
my wrong has ended&mdash;she has assured me that she could never
be happy separated from you, and that you are wedded to your
people." Mr. Sinclair shaded with his hand features quivering
with emotion. "At present," continued Captain Percy, "these
feelings, which are both of them too sacred for me to contest,
place a barrier between us, and I have sought from her no
promise for the future&mdash;if she can forget me&mdash;" Captain
Percy paused a moment, then added abruptly&mdash;"may a
happier destiny be hers than I could have commanded&mdash;but,
sir, the time may come when England shall no longer need
all her soldiers&mdash;an orphan and an only child, I have nothing
to bind me to her soil&mdash;should I seek you then, and find your
Mary with an unchanged heart, will you give her to me?&mdash;will
you receive me as a son?"</p>

<p>"Under such circumstances I would do so joyfully," Mr.
Sinclair replied, "yet I cannot conceal from you now that I
grieve to know that my daughter must wear out her youth in
a hope long deferred at best, perhaps never to be realized."</p>

<p>Both gentlemen were for a few minutes plunged in silent
thought. Captain Percy arose from his seat&mdash;walked several
times across the room, and then stopping before the table at
which Mr. Sinclair was seated, resumed the conversation.</p>

<p>"Had I designedly sought the interest with which your
daughter has honored me," he said, "your words would inflict
on me intolerable self-reproach, but I cannot blame myself for
not being silent when silence would have been a reproach to
her delicacy and a libel on my own affection. Now, however,
sir, I yield myself wholly to your cooler judgment and better
knowledge of her nature, and I will do whatever may in your
opinion conduce to her happiness, without respect to my own
feelings. If you think that she can forget the past, and you
desire that she should"&mdash;his voice lost its firmness and he
grasped with violence the chair on which he leaned&mdash;"I will<a class='page' name ='Page_251' id='Page_251' title='251'>&nbsp;</a>
do nothing to recall it to her memory. It is the only <i>amende</i>
I can make for the shadow I have thrown upon her life&mdash;dark
indeed will such a resolve leave my own."</p>

<p>"It would cast no ray of light on hers. Be assured her
love is not a thing to be forgotten&mdash;it is a part of her life."</p>

<p>"And it shall be repaid with all of mine which my duties
as a soldier and subject leave at my disposal. Do not think
me altogether selfish when I say that your words have left no
place in my heart for any thing but happiness&mdash;I have but
one thing more to ask you&mdash;it is a great favor&mdash;inexpressibly
great&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;nay," Mr. Sinclair exclaimed, gathering his meaning
more from his looks and manner than from the words
which fell slowly from his lips&mdash;"ask me not so soon to put
the irrevocable seal upon a bond which may be one of
misery."</p>

<p>"If your words be true&mdash;if her love be a part of her life,
the irrevocable seal has been already affixed by Heaven, and I
only ask you to give your sanction to it, that by uniting her
duty and her love, you may save her gentle spirit all contest
with itself, and give her the fairest hope of future joy."</p>

<p>It was now Mr. Sinclair's turn to rise and pace the floor in
agitated silence&mdash;"I know not how to decide so suddenly on
so momentous a question," he at length exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Suppose you leave its decision to her whom it most
concerns. It is for her happiness we are most anxious&mdash;so entirely
is that my object that I would not influence her determination
even by a look. I will not even ask to be present
when you place my proposal before her; but I must repeat,
sir, if you design to do it, there is no time to be lost, for I
must be on my way to Canada to-morrow."</p>

<p>"So be it then&mdash;she shall choose for herself, and Heaven
direct her choice!"</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_252' id='Page_252' title='252'>&nbsp;</a>"Amen!" responded Captain Percy, as Mr. Sinclair turned
from the door. He heard him ascend the stairs, and ask and
receive admission to his daughter's room. Then he counted
the seconds as they grew into minutes&mdash;the minutes as they
extended to a quarter of an hour&mdash;a half-hour&mdash;and rolled
slowly on towards the hour which lacked but little to its completion,
when his straining ear caught the sound of an opening
door, and then Mr. Sinclair's sedate step was heard slowly descending
the stairs and approaching the study. Captain Percy
met him at the door, and looked the inquiry which he could
not speak. Mr. Sinclair replied to the look, "She is yours!"</p>

<p>"May I not see her and receive such a confirmation of my
hopes from her own lips!"</p>

<p>"Not to-night&mdash;I have persuaded her to retire at once&mdash;she
needs repose, and we must be early astir. Your marriage
must for many reasons be kept secret at present, and as I could
not, I fear, find witnesses here on whose silence I could rely,
we will accompany you in the morning to Major Scott's, and
there, in the presence of his wife and sister, your vows shall
receive the sanction of the church. You must have some
preparation to make, and I will bid you good night, for there
are certain legal preliminaries necessary to the validity of a
marriage here, to which I must attend this evening&mdash;unusual
as the hour is."</p>

<p>There was a strange mingling of emotion in the hearts of
the lovers as they stood side by side within that room in the
gray dawn of the next morning. In a few hours they were to
part, they knew not for what distance of space or duration of
time. It might be that they should never after this morning
look upon each other's faces in life; yet, ere they parted, there
was to be a bond upon their souls which should make <i>them</i>
ever present to each other, should give them the same interests,
should, as it were, mould their beings into one. Sacred
bond of God's own forming, which thus offers the support of a<a class='page' name ='Page_253' id='Page_253' title='253'>&nbsp;</a>
spiritual and indissoluble union amidst the separations and
changes of this ever-varying life! No such strength and
peace are to be found in the frail and casual ties for which man
in his folly would exchange this bond of Heaven.</p>

<p>Few words were spoken during the burned breakfast at
the parsonage, or the drive to Major Scott's, for deep emotion
is ever silent. Yet not for them were the coy reserves often
evinced by hearts on the verge of a life-union&mdash;the faltering
timidity which hesitates to lift the veil from feelings in whose
light existence is thenceforth to pass. They could not forget
that they were to part, and even Mary hesitated not to let her
lover read in her eyes' shadowy depths the tenderness which
might soothe the parting pang, and whose memory might
brighten the hours of separation.</p>

<p>Why should we linger on a scene which each heart can
depict for itself? With solemn tenderness the father pronounced
the words which transferred to another the right to
his own earthly sanctuary&mdash;the heart of his daughter&mdash;and
committed to another's keeping&mdash;his last and brightest earthly
treasure. That treasure was soon, however, returned, for a
time, to his care. The vows of the marriage rite had scarcely
been uttered, when with one long clasp&mdash;one whispered word&mdash;one
lingering look&mdash;the disciplined soldier turned from his
newly-found joy to his duties. Never had Mary seemed more
lovely in his eyes or her father's than in that moment, when
with quivering lips, eyes "heavy with unshed tears," and
cheeks white with anguish, she yet smiled upon him to the
last. Nor did her heroic self-control cease when he was gone.
Her father was still there, and for him she endured and was
silent. Only by her languid movements and fading color
did he learn the bitterness of her soul through the weary
months of her sorrow. Weary months were they indeed!</p>

<p>One letter she received from Captain Percy, written before<a class='page' name ='Page_254' id='Page_254' title='254'>&nbsp;</a>
he had passed beyond the limits of the United States. It
breathed the very soul of tenderness. "My wife!" he wrote,
"what joy is summed in that little word&mdash;what faith in the
present&mdash;what promise for the future! I find myself often
repeating it again and again with a lingering cadence, while
your gentle eyes seem smiling at my folly." Long, long did
Mary wear this letter next her heart, and still no other came
to take its place.</p>

<p>They had parted in 1813, just as the falling leaves came
to herald the approach of winter. That winter passed with
Mary in vain longing and vainer hopes. Spring again clothed
her home with beauty, but there came no spring to her heart.
Summer brought joy and gladness to the earth, but not to her,
and another autumn closed over her in anxious suspense.
There were moments when she could almost have prayed to
have that dread silence broken even by a voice from the tomb&mdash;other
times in which she threw herself on her knees in
thankfulness that she could yet hope. From Major Scott she
had heard that Captain Percy's regiment had been sent to the
South, but of him individually even Major Scott knew nothing.
At length came the eighth of January, that day of
vain triumph on which thousands fell in the contest for rights
already lost and won&mdash;the treaty of peace having been signed
at Ghent on the twenty-fourth of the preceding month. Forgetful
of this useless hecatomb at war's relentless shrine,
America echoed the gratulations of the victors which fell with
scathing power on the heart of the trembling Mary. How
could she hope that he, the fearless soldier, had escaped this
scene of slaughter! If he had, surely he would now find some
way to inform her of his safety, but weeks passed on, and
passed still in silence.</p>

<p>During this long period of suspense, no doubt of the tenderness
and truth of him she loved had ever sullied Mary's<a class='page' name ='Page_255' id='Page_255' title='255'>&nbsp;</a>
faith. Mr. Sinclair was not always thus confiding, and once,
on seeing the deadly pallor that overspread her face on hearing
the announcement of "no letters"&mdash;he uttered words of
keen reproach on him who could so wrong her gentle heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, father!" Mary exclaimed, "speak not thus&mdash;be assured
it is not his fault&mdash;remember that no license could tempt
him to wrong the defenceless&mdash;think how honorable he was in
suppressing his own feelings lest their avowal should bring
sorrow on us&mdash;and when my self-betrayal unsealed his lips,
how delicate to me, how generous to you was his conduct&mdash;and
who but he could have been so rigid in his observance of
a soldier's duty, yet so inexpressibly tender as a man! I loved
him because I saw him thus true and noble&mdash;and having seen
him thus how can I doubt him? He may be no longer on
earth, but wherever he is, he is my true and noble husband,
and you will not again distress me, dear father, by speaking as
though you doubted him."</p>

<p>"Never," said Mr. Sinclair emphatically, and he never did,
though he saw her form grow thinner, and her cheek paler
every day, and before the winter was gone heard that deep,
hollow cough from her, which has so often sounded the knell
of hope to the anxious heart. With the coming on of summer
this cough passed away, but Mary was oppressed by great
feebleness and languor&mdash;scarcely less fatal symptoms. Still
she omitted none of those cares essential to her father's comfort&mdash;while
to the poor, the sick, the sorrowing, she was more
than ever an angel of mercy. With feeble steps and slow she
still walked her accustomed round of charity, and thus living
for duty she lived for God, and had His peace shed abroad in
her heart, even while sorrow was wearing away the springs of
her life. She loved to sit alone and send her thoughts forward
to the future&mdash;not of this life, but of that higher life in which
there shall be no shadow on the brightness of our joy&mdash;where<a class='page' name ='Page_256' id='Page_256' title='256'>&nbsp;</a>
love shall be without fear&mdash;no war shall desolate&mdash;no opposing
duty shall separate&mdash;no death shall place its stony barrier
between loving hearts. With a mind thus occupied, she wandered
one day, in the latter part of August, through the garden
of the parsonage and the yard immediately surrounding
the church into the little inclosure beyond, within which was
the green and flowery knoll that marked her mother's last
resting-place. As she turned again towards her home the
sound of a carriage driven rapidly by caused her to look towards
the road which lay about a hundred yards distant. The
carriage rushed by, and she caught but a glimpse of a gentleman
leaning from its window. In another moment a grove of
trees had hidden both the carriage and its occupant from her
sight&mdash;yet that glimpse had sent a thrill through her whole
frame&mdash;a mist passed over her eyes, and with eager, trembling
steps, she proceeded on her way. As she reached the garden,
she thought she saw her father approaching it from the house,
but her path led through a summer-house, and when she had
passed through it he was no longer visible. Every thing in
the house wore its usual air of quietness on her entrance, and
with a feeling of disappointment, for which she could not
rationally account, she turned her steps towards her father's
study. As she drew near the door she heard his voice&mdash;the
words, "I dread to tell her," met her ear and made her heart
stand still. One step more and she was at the door&mdash;she
looked eagerly forward, and with a glad cry sprang into the
extended arms of her husband.</p>

<p>It was long before any of the party were sufficiently composed
for conversation. When that time came, Captain
or rather Colonel Percy heard with surprise that no letters had
been received from him since his joining the army in Canada.
He had written often, but had been obliged to send his letters
to some distant post-town by his own servant. As he had de<a class='page' name ='Page_257' id='Page_257' title='257'>&nbsp;</a>clined
accompanying Colonel Percy to America, there was reason
to suppose that he had suspected the character of the correspondence,
perhaps had acquainted himself fully with the
contents of the letters, and had taken effectual means to prevent
their reaching their destination, with the hope of thus completely
removing from Colonel Percy's mind every inducement
to return to this country. Having received a disabling though
not dangerous wound at the battle of New Orleans, Colonel
then Major Percy was sent home with despatches, and was immediately
ordered to join the army under Lord Wellington,
then rapidly hastening to repel the attempt of the prisoner of
Elba to re-establish himself on the throne of France. From
this period till the battle of Waterloo all private concerns were
merged in the interest and the hurry of great public events.
In that battle Major Percy was again slightly wounded. His
distinguished bravery was rewarded by his being made again
the bearer of despatches to England. As it was evident to all
that the struggle which had called the whole force of Britain
into the field was now at an end, he had no hesitation in asking
and no difficulty in obtaining leave of absence from the commander-in-chief,
and had lost no time in embarking for
America.</p>

<p>"As a consequence of peace," said Colonel Percy in conclusion,
"a large part of our force will be disbanded, and
many officers put on half-pay. A friend who is very influential
at head quarters has undertaken to secure me a place on
the list of the latter&mdash;and henceforth, dear Mary, your home
is mine!"</p>

<p>"And did you never doubt me during all this long
silence?" he asked of his happy wife a few days after his
return.</p>

<p>"Never," said Mary firmly, and then added in a more
playful manner&mdash;"if I should step into the confessor's chair,
could you answer as boldly?"</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_258' id='Page_258' title='258'>&nbsp;</a>"I can, Mary&mdash;though I never received a line from you, it
never occurred to me to fear any change in your affection.
Our marriage had placed on it the seal of duty, and your conduct
in relation to your father had shown me that that seal
you could not easily break."</p>

<p>"Then you did not love me less for not yielding every
other consideration to the gratification of your wishes?" said
Mary, endeavoring to speak lightly, but betraying deeper feeling
by the slight tremor in her voice, and the quick blush
mantling in her cheek.</p>

<p>"Love you less!" exclaimed Colonel Percy warmly&mdash;"my
love had been little worthy of your acceptance, dearest, had it
been lessened by seeing that your principles were paramount
even to your affections. Happy would it be for all your sex,
Mary, did they recognize as the only test of a true and noble
love, that it increases with the increase of esteem, and finds
more pleasure in the excellence of its object than in its own
selfish triumphs."</p>

<p>Ere the winter of 1815 had set in, Mary's rounded form and
blooming cheek relieved all Mr. Sinclair's apprehension of her
consumptive tendencies, and proved that her love was indeed,
as he had said, "a part of her life."</p>

<p>The New-Year's day&mdash;the day after which the year is no longer
new&mdash;is come and gone; and while sitting here to record its
events before I sleep, I look back at it with pleasure, chastened
by such thoughts as the young seldom have. I believe of all
such eras the aged may say as the poet says of his birthday:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"What a different sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That word had in my younger years!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every time the chain comes round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Less and less bright the link appears."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To all, these eras mark their progress on the journey of
life; but to the young they are bright with the promise of a
happier future; the aged, they direct to the grave of the buried
past, and they read on them the inscription so often found on
the Roman monumental stones, "Siste, Viator." Travellers are
we from time to eternity, and it is well that we should meet
with these imperative calls to stand and consider. Cheered by
the Christian's hope, we can stand; we can look steadily on
the past, count the lengthening line of these memorials of our
dead years, and feel that but few more probably lie between us
and the river of death, yet, strong in the might of Death's great
Conqueror, "bate no jot of heart or hope."</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_260' id='Page_260' title='260'>&nbsp;</a>These are grave though not sad thoughts; too grave to
mingle readily with the record of mirthful scenes, howsoever
innocent may have been the mirth. I must, therefore, lay aside
my pen, and reserve the description of our New-Year for tomorrow.</p>

<p>Our New-Year opened with a cold and cloudless morning,
and our party met at breakfast with faces as bright as the sun.
Gifts were exchanged between the parents and children, the
brothers and sisters&mdash;gifts, trifling in themselves, but dear from
their association with the cherished givers. It was an endearing
sight to see the venerable parents receiving from their
children testimonies of that affectionate consideration which the
care and tenderness of years had so well deserved. Tears were
on Mrs. Donaldson's cheeks, and even the Colonel's eyes glistened
as they clasped one after another of their children to their
hearts, and invoked on them the blessing of Heaven. From
this scene Mr. Arlington and I had stood aloof, silent, but not
uninterested spectators. As the excitement of the principal
actors subsided, we approached and tendered our hearty congratulations,
and received equally hearty congratulations in
return. Neither had Aunt Nancy been altogether forgotten in
the mementos of affection provided for the day; and I thought
Mr. Arlington looked a little envious as Annie, with a kiss,
threw around my neck a chain woven of her own hair, and
suspended to it the eye-glass which I always wore. I do not
know but his envy may have been somewhat allayed by a very
handsomely decorated copy of an English work on sporting,
with which Col. Donaldson presented him. He had scarcely
found time, however, to admire it, when all attention was attracted
to Philip Donaldson, who entered with a servant bearing
the mysterious box to which I have before alluded.</p>

<p>"There is my New-Year present to you, Annie," he said, as
he began to open it.  All drew near and looked on with<a class='page' name ='Page_261' id='Page_261' title='261'>&nbsp;</a>
interest, yet few felt much surprise when, the cover being
removed, a Greek dress was disclosed. From the rich head-dress
of silvered muslin to the embroidered slipper, all was
complete. Annie looked on with a smile as he displayed piece
after piece&mdash;yet her smile wore some appearance of constraint;
and when Philip, drawing her to him, kissed her cheek and
said, "Not a word for me, Annie!" with her thanks were mingled
some hesitating expressions of apprehension that this dress
would be very conspicuous, concluding with the timid question,
"Do you really wish me to wear it this evening, Philip?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Annie. It was in order to show you in this
dress that I proposed fancy dresses for this evening; you will
not disappoint me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not&mdash;at least not willingly&mdash;I will wear it. If
I wear it ungracefully you will forgive me?"</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of that," said Philip, as he glanced at her
glowing face with a brother's gratified pride.</p>

<p>Miss Donaldson advised that Annie should try on the dress
at once, as she prudently suggested it might require some
alteration.</p>

<p>"Come with me, Aunt Nancy," said Annie as she left the
room to comply with this advice.</p>

<p>"Come back here and let us see you, Annie, when you
have put it on," said Col. Donaldson.</p>

<p>Annie would have passed from the room without an
answer, evading the compliance which she could not refuse,
but the Colonel called her back and did not dismiss her till
assured that the request, which he knew would be regarded as
a command, had been heard.</p>

<p>The dress needed no alteration. We afterwards found that
Philip had sent his friend a measure procured from Annie's
maid, and the fit was perfect. I am not quite sure that Annie,
as she saw the beautiful figure reflected in her glass, regretted<a class='page' name ='Page_262' id='Page_262' title='262'>&nbsp;</a>
the command which compelled her to show herself to the party
awaiting her in the library, to which we had withdrawn from
the breakfasting room, that we might not interfere with the
household operations, of which the latter was, at this hour, the
scene. Yet it was with a little coy delay and blushing timidity
that she, at length, suffered me to lead her thither.</p>

<p>"Beautiful!"&mdash;"I never saw her look so well!"&mdash;"I knew
it would become her!" were the exclamations that greeted
her, on her entrance, deepening the flush upon her cheek, and
calling up a brighter smile to her lips. Mr. Arlington alone
was silent, but his soul was in his eyes, and they spoke an
admiration compared to which the words of others were tame.</p>

<p>"My dear Annie," said her mother, as she gazed delightedly
upon her, "how I wish I had a likeness of you in that
dress!&mdash;you do look so remarkably well in it."</p>

<p>Mr. Arlington stepped forward. "Would you permit me&mdash;"
to Mrs. Donaldson&mdash;"Would you do me the favor&mdash;" to
Annie&mdash;"Might I be allowed&mdash;" with a glance at the Colonel,
"to gratify Mrs. Donaldson's wish. It should be my New-Year's
offering. I would ask only an hour of your time&mdash;"
deprecatingly to Annie. "That would give me an outline
which I could fill up without troubling you."</p>

<p>Mr. Arlington was so earnest, and Mrs. Donaldson so gratefully
pleased, that if Annie had any objections, they were completely
overborne. Mr. Arlington produced his sketching materials,
and disposed his subject and his light, and then
intimated so plainly that the consciousness of the observation
of others would be fatal to his success, that we withdrew,
leaving only Philip with a book in a distant corner "to play
propriety," as he whispered to me on passing, with a mischievous
glance at the blushing Annie.</p>

<p>And now the reader doubtless thinks, that in the engraving
prefixed to this volume, he has a copy of the sketch made on<a class='page' name ='Page_263' id='Page_263' title='263'>&nbsp;</a>
this New-Year's morning. In this, however, he deceives himself,
for the work of this morning amounted to the merest and
most unfinished outline, which would have stood for Zuleika as
well as for Annie Donaldson. Yet instead of one hour, Annie
generously allowed Mr. Arlington nearly to triple the time.
How he was occupied during all this time, I cannot tell, though
that he did not spend all of it in drawing I had ocular demonstration.</p>

<p>Nearly three hours, as I have said, had passed since we left
the library, when, looking from my window, I saw Philip, returning
to the house on horseback. Having left in the library
a book in which I was much interested, I had been waiting
somewhat impatiently for Annie's appearance, to satisfy me
that I might without intrusion return thither for it. I now concluded,
somewhat too hastily, as it afterwards proved, from
seeing Philip abroad, that the sitting was at an end, and accordingly
went for my book. I entered noiselessly, I suppose&mdash;I
am usually quiet in my movements&mdash;by a door directly
opposite to the seat which Mr. Arlington had arranged for
himself, and behind the sofa on which, at his desire, Annie
had been seated when I left her. There still was Mr. Arlington's
seat, and before it a table with the drawing materials and
unfinished sketch, but Mr. Arlington was on the sofa beside
Annie. He was speaking, but in tones so low, that even had
I wished it, I could not have heard him; but the few seconds
for which surprise kept me chained to the spot, were sufficient
to suggest the subject of those murmured words. The reader
will probably conjecture that subject without aid from me, when
I tell him what I saw. Of Annie, as she sat with her back to
me, I could only see the drooping head and one crimson ear
and cheek; Mr. Arlington's face was turned to her, and was
glowing with joy, and as it seemed to me with triumph. Before
I had turned away, he raised her hand to his lips. I saw<a class='page' name ='Page_264' id='Page_264' title='264'>&nbsp;</a>
that it rested unresistingly in his clasp; and gliding through
the door by which I stood, I closed it softly and left them unconscious
of my presence.</p>

<p>The invitations had been given for the early hour of half-past
seven, and at seven, by previous arrangement, our own
party collected in the library dressed for the evening. There
stood Col. Donaldson in the uniform of a continental major,
gallantly attending a lady whose fine dark eyes and sweet
smile revealed Mrs. Seagrove, notwithstanding the crimped and
powdered hair, patched face, hoop, furbelows, and farthingale,
which would have carried us back to the days of Queen Anne.
Mrs. Dudley, in similar costume, was attended by Philip
Donaldson, who looked a perfect gentleman of the Sir Charles
Grandison style in his full dress, with bag-wig and sword.
Arthur Donaldson, in the graceful and becoming costume of the
gallant Hotspur, was seated with his Kate by his side, and if
Kate Percy looked but half as lovely in her bridal array as did
her present representative, she was well worthy a hero's
homage. But in the background, evidently shrinking from
observation, stood a figure more interesting to me than all
these&mdash;it was our "sweet Annie" as Zuleika&mdash;our Bride, <i>not</i>
of Abydos&mdash;leaning on the arm of a Selim habited in a costume
as correct and as magnificent as her own, yet who could
scarcely be said to <i>look</i> the character well; the open brow of
Mr. Arlington, where lofty and serene thought seemed to have
fixed its throne, and his eyes bright with present enjoyment
and future hope, bearing little resemblance to our imaginations
of the wronged and desperate Selim, whose very joy seemed
but a lightning flash, lending intenser darkness to the night of
his despair. I was the last to enter the room, and as I approached
Mr. Arlington, he presented me with a very beautiful
bouquet. I found afterwards that he had made the same
graceful offering to each of the ladies at the Manor, having<a class='page' name ='Page_265' id='Page_265' title='265'>&nbsp;</a>
received them from the city, to which he had sent for his Greek
dress and Philip's wig. Put up in the ingenious cases now
used for this purpose, the flowers had come looking as freshly
as though they had that moment been plucked. The bouquet
appropriated to Annie differed from all the others. It was
composed of white camelias, moss-rose buds, and violets. As
I was admiring it, Annie pointed to one of the rose-buds as
being eminently lovely in its formation and beautiful in its
delicate shading. It was beautiful, but my attention was more
attracted by the sparkling of a diamond ring I had never
before seen upon her finger. The diamond was unusually
large, the antique setting tasteful. With an inconsideration of
which I flatter myself I am not often guilty, I exclaimed in
surprised admiration, "Why, Annie, where did you get that
beautiful ring?"</p>

<p>The sudden withdrawing of the little hand, the quick flushing
of cheek, neck, brow, told the tale at once; a tale corroborated
by the smiling glance which met mine as it was turned
for a moment on Mr. Arlington. Her confusion was beautiful,
but he was too generous to enjoy it, and strove to bring me
back to the flowers.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen some beautiful verses, translated from
the German, by Edward Everett I believe, entitled 'The Flower
Angels?'" he asked.</p>

<p>"I never did; can you repeat them?"</p>

<p>He answered by immediately reciting the verses which I
here give to the reader.</p>

<p>The visitors soon began to arrive. There were among
them some amusing characters, so well supported as to give
rise during the evening to many entertaining scenes; but to
me this was the group and this the incident of the evening.
Not a group or an incident for prurient curiosity or frivolous
jest, but for an earnest and reverent recognition of that beautiful
law imposed on Nature by her Great Author, by which
the feeble delight in receiving, and the strong in giving support&mdash;that
law by which a pure and self-abnegating affection
is made the source of life in all its commingling relations&mdash;of
its duties and its sympathies&mdash;its joys and its sorrows&mdash;of its
severest probation and its loftiest development.</p>

<p><a class='page' name ='Page_268' id='Page_268' title='268'>&nbsp;</a>It was in the solemnity of spirit, engendered by thoughts
like these, that I stood at the window of my room, looking
forth upon the still and moonlit night, long after our friends
had left us. My door opened softly and Annie glided in, and
ere I was aware of her presence, was standing beside me with
her head resting on my shoulder. A tear was on the cheek to
which I pressed my lips. A few whispered words told me
whence the ring came&mdash;but not for the public are the pure,
guileless confidences of that hour.</p>

<p>Our holiday festivities were over, and the next day the
Christmas Guests departed. They had stepped aside awhile
from the dusty thoroughfares on which they were accustomed
to pursue their several avocations, for the interchange of friendly
sympathy with each other, and the offering of grateful hearts
to Heaven, and now they were returning, cheered and strengthened
to their allotted work. Reader, go thou and do likewise</p>
